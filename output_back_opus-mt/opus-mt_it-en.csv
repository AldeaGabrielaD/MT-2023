"""Mass migration is a hybrid war directed against our stability. State actors, such as Morocco, Belarus and Turkey, have already taken advantage of mass migration."""
"""Mass migration is a hybrid war directed against our stability. NGOs organise, finance and promote migration to gain benefits."""
"""Migration has completely lost control. The EU refuses to see its size. Hundreds of millions love to migrate. All people without the right language and proper education. The huge number of immigrants threatens the existence of EU societies through crime, poverty and housing shortages."""
 Refugees can obtain a visa at an embassy in one of the 54 African countries. All other immigrants must be repatriated within a week of arrival.
"""There are Member States in the European Union that do not want asylum seekers in their country. For example, Denmark sends back all the sirens and other Arabs."""
Fear of the unknown is normal behavior. He has saved our race for centuries since humanity was a simple monkey among others. 
"""Moreover, when fear is reinforced by facts such as increasing violence in every country with a large number of immigrants, and the rape of women is not a problem of ""perception,"" but a simple reality."""
Stop immigration from non-European or non-first world countries into the EU.
"""Instead of trying to stop immigration, we must create a good integration plan and at the same time improve living conditions in the countries of the second and third world. This includes the fight for climate justice and the decrease in the unequal distribution of wealth among countries."""
We need some rules for integration: integration does not mean abandoning European values and culture.
There must be some rules for integration: integration does not mean completely open borders.
I am pleased to see that the idea of dealing with all immigration from non-European countries or from the first world continues to be strong. This message must be communicated very clearly in Brussels. 
No more non-European immigration. The European natives said NO.
European citizens are the future of Europe! 
"""Litigating to keep migrants out is very shortsighted and unhistorical. By keeping migrants out, migratory pressure will not decrease. So, what do you suggest next year, 10 years from now? """
"""Migration has been a historical fact and successful societies have found a way to transform migration into force. In our case, in order to alleviate the current long-term challenge, we must alleviate the migratory pressure by making it attractive for migrants to remain and help develop their own countries. Such a useful project, a European Marshal Plan for Africa would be a good project to invest in. The long-term return on investment would be more than financial: a friendly neighbouring continent, good relations, access to the African market and natural resources. It's not a short-term solution. And there's no short-term solution. We have to play for a long time!"""
"""Why can't Arab countries repair refugees from other Arab countries? The same habits, religion and have enough wealth."""
its is the question of public sector policy and policy. No objective must be pursued. No problem to solve. I guess it's the nature of the beast. Balance conflicting interests. 
A humanitarian association that helps a migrant to enter the EU illegally should lose its government/EU funding.
"""We should stop immigration from non-European countries or not from the first world in the European Union. However, if we are to stop this immigration, we must stop its causes. Indeed, it is European, Chinese and American war, poverty and neo-colonialism that has caused the people of African countries and the Middle East to flee to Europe. So Europe must finally take responsibility and protect these countries from corruption, war and neocolonialism and help them start their economy."""
Migration from countries with incompatible cultural values and ideologies should be limited or stopped to ensure social cohesion in Europe. Obsolete ideologies and regressive values should not have a place in Europe. 
"""Migrants who are already (legally) here should be taught Western values so that they and their families can integrate/assimilate themselves, as the old saying says ""when in Rome, do as the Romans do."""""
"""What we're seeing now is the first waves of a human tsunami. In sub-Saharan Africa, over the years the population will have grown to 2.0 billion.  This is more than the citizens living in the European Union and the United States today.  At the same time, the population in the EU is shrinking. When we keep the border open, the European Union as a vital society will disappear.  There is not much future for young Europeans."""
Entering the EU without permission automatically excludes a person from the right to asylum. 
"We must put an end to all loopholes - for example, automatically rejecting asylum applications from anyone who illegally enters Europe."
"""In conclusion, we should say: """"Europeans go home. Go home, leave every part of the world where we do business, exploiting cheap labor, rare minerals, selling weapons, invading foreign countries and exporting democracy, etc."""
"""Demographic problems for the European Union, which are real, must be solved by encouraging children and a generous family policy, not through immigration. We have to celebrate motherhood and moms. We must realise that the education of a child entails serious costs for today's Europe."""
"""Multiculturalism creates chaos wherever it exists. Sweden in Stockholm has become the capital of the rape of the West, and the number of bombs and shootings is skyrocketing in that country as well. France borders with the civil war, entire territories are no longer under the control of the State. Europe must stop migration and asylum indefinitely. We must put our European peoples first, as the whole world is doing while our civilization commits suicide on the basis of values imposed by narcissists of the saints."""
"""There is nothing wrong with not wanting your continent to become chaos and putting your people first, every civilization in this world takes that idea as obvious. We must negotiate Remigration agreements with third countries to send back their citizens and we must use Frontex to reject all migrants who reach our borders."""
EU leadership fails to carry out its core tasks: guarding its own border and protecting its own people. Even 30 years after the introduction of Schengen. 
Immigration should not be part of humanitarian aid. Humanitarian aid should be delivered directly to Africa/Asia. The agreement with Turkey should eventually be abolished.
"""Europe must remain Europe and citizens must not be imposed a cultural and religious change that they do not want and that is insane. Look at what Arab or North African countries have become after 1400 years of Islamism."""
A humanitarian association that helps a migrant to enter the EU illegally should be required to provide financial support under dignified conditions. 
"""A humanitarian association that helps a migrant to enter the EU illegally should also be dragged before the court for not having brought illegal immigrants to the safest port. In 90% of cases, the nearest port is Africa."""
We must stop all funding for NGOs and all migration organisations within the European Union. Then we can talk about how to help people already here and how to help real people in need.
We must agree that people who do not comply with our immigration law are detained in return centres.
The country of origin should absolutely be the most important criterion for deciding who we allow to enter our countries. 160 French would still be alive if we put the welfare of ours above the people whose countries the Americans bombed to shreds.
""" It is time, to be honest about this! Europeans have the right to self-determination like any other country out there! This is our home and a home for all is a home for no one."""
Our European continent is in debt and does not have the resources to take care of people who have never paid taxes and continue to ignore our laws! We already have enough poor people in Europe and we must take care of them!
"I do not share the idea of taking away the right of asylum and the right to live in the European Union because they have come illegally. Instead, I would suggest facilitating legal migration. That way you don't need to illegally migrate and risk your life while you do it."
"""The division of refugees is a long-discussed plan. But in the end, no group involved agrees with these plans. Some countries don't like these people at all. """
