"""From my point of view, it will be essential to impose some countervailing duties on products from third countries to ensure that they do not have a competitive advantage."""
"""Eventually, the best solution would be a global agreement (as within the OECD and with a similar mentality) as the global minimum tax rate."""
"""Of course I do! If the Eurocrats cared what people wanted, they would ask them."""
"""The cheap and accessible train journeys bring everyone closer, regardless of borders"""
"""We should think of more opportunities to legally enter the EU. Many people come illegally, because we refuse them the opportunities to come, stay for a time to work or to receive education and perhaps come back later. People die for that nonsense."""
"""I recently read that especially African families tend to send their smarter and better educated young people abroad to improve the family situation. These people are desperately needed both for the future of their countries of origin and for our future. We need trained and educated people in many sectors, but we send them back to their countries of origin, because they were unfortunate enough to be refugees."""
"""It has to work as with air transport: Book a consistent journey from A to B operated by different companies, and make sure that if something goes wrong, there will be a solution (rebooking,...)."""
Nuclear energy is not green because of radioactive waste.
"""I agree, no one should emigrate to a country if they are going to commit a crime."""
"""Nuclear energy is simply too expensive and therefore not economically viable. According to RethinkX researchers, in the next ten years there will be an interruption of clean energy that will leave empty investments in oil, coal and nuclear energy."""
"""Africa and the Middle East have the highest birth rate in the world. Africa has up to 7 children per woman. The EU has 1.55.  It is this high birth rate that keeps them poor. There is hardly anything the EU can do about it."""
The EU is not responsible for everyone.
All refugee camps must be closed. And the illegals returned to the last country they left. 
Helping migrants learn the language and culture of the country in which they live is fundamental to successful integration. The language and rules of the labour market and the workplace should also be incorporated.
Africa is the only continent in which the number of young people continues to increase. 
Talking about what happened in the past between Africa and Europe is useless. All the slaves and their owners died a long time ago. You can't blame grandchildren.
"""If there are language problems, we need to work on national integration systems, for example. in France, where English is being thought of in French. language."""
We already have English as an exchange language.
"""English is ideal as it is spoken internationally as a language of trade, travel and political exchange. Esperanto is not."""
Migration is part of a human being and has always occurred throughout history.    
"""The EU needs a humane, civilized and legal way of managing migration, whether for economic reasons or to seek international protection."""
EU Member States need to lift together instead of trying to impose burdens on each other or on external nations.
"""We have to accept more immigrants to fight the ageing of the European population. Immigrants also age, but before that they usually have children."""
"""Paying taxes is not enough, if you want to become a citizen with full rights you need to fully embrace the country you live in."""
"""If young Europeans live abroad, they will feel racism on their own in the country in which they live."""
"""No duck would like to live with eagles or sparrows.  That is nature, not desires."""
Migrants completely lack critical thinking.  
Migrants voluntarily risk their lives.
Migrants depend on the social systems of other countries.
Migrants sell drugs.
The EU should recognise the fact that rising birth rates in Europe and supporting European families to have (more) children is the most appropriate long-term solution.
"""To increase the birth rate and support young families, Hungary should be an example. We must not depend on migration for this."""
The emphasis on negative stereotypes towards migrants comes mainly from people who do not know Africans or other migrants or refugees. 
"""Migrants have a huge amount to offer in energy, new ideas and cultures. Why this emphasis on imaginary 'tomas'?"""
"""If asylum applications are submitted from abroad, the costs for EU taxpayers of processing asylum seekers are reduced."""
"""If asylum applications are submitted from abroad, the humanitarian crisis in the Mediterranean Sea will end."""
"""If asylum applications are submitted from abroad, the risks to the safety of asylum seekers are considerably reduced."""
"""Mass migration is a hybrid war directed against our stability. State actors, such as Morocco, Belarus and Turkey, have already taken advantage of mass migration. """
"""Mass migration is a hybrid war directed against our stability. NGOs organize, finance and promote migration for benefits."""
"""Migration has gone completely out of control. The EU refuses to see its magnitude. Hundreds of millions like to migrate. All people without the right language and adequate education. The large number of immigrants threatens the existence of EU societies, through crime, poverty and housing shortages."""
 Refugees can obtain a visa from an embassy in one of the 54 African countries. All other immigrants must be returned within one week of their arrival.
"""There are Member States in the European Union that do not want any asylum seekers in their country. For example, Denmark returns all Syrens and other Arabs."""
Fear of the unknown is normal behavior. He has saved our race from ages that began when humanity was a simple monkey among others. 
"""In addition, when fear is reinforced by events such as the increase in violence in all countries with a high number of immigrants and rapes of women, it is not a problem of ""perception,"" but a simple reality."""
Stop all immigration from non-European or non-European countries from the first world to the EU.
"""Instead of trying to stop immigration, we need to create a good integration plan and at the same time improve living conditions in the countries of the 2nd and 3rd worlds. This includes the fight for climate justice and the reduction of unequal distribution of wealth among countries."""
Some rules need to be in place for integration: Integration does not mean abandoning European values and culture.
There must be some rules for integration: Integration does not mean completely open borders.
I am pleased to see that the idea of dealing with all immigration from non-European or non-first world countries remains strong. This message must be sent very clearly to Brussels. 
No more non-European immigration. The native Europeans have said NO.
European citizens are the future of Europe! 
"""Just arguing to keep migrants out is very short-sighted and unhistorical. By keeping migrants out, migration pressure will not decrease. So what do you suggest for next year, 10 years from now?"""
"""Migration has been a fact of history and successful societies have found ways to turn migration into strength. In our case, to alleviate the current long-term challenge, we need to ease migratory pressure by making it attractive for migrants to remain in place and help develop their own countries. Such a useful project, a European Marshal Plan for Africa would be a good project to invest in. The long-term return on investment would be more than financial: a friendly neighbouring continent, good relations, access to the African market and natural resources. That is not a short-term solution. And there is no short-term solution. We have to play the long game!"""
"""Why can't Arab countries host refugees from other Arab countries? The same habits, religion and have enough wealth."""
is the subject of public sector policy and policy formulation. No targets will be pursued. There are no problems to solve. I guess it's the nature of the beast. Balance of conflicting interests. 
A humanitarian partnership that helps a migrant enter the EU illegally should lose its government/EU funding.
"""We must stop all immigration from non-European or non-EU countries. However, if we want to stop this immigration, we must stop its causes. Indeed, it is war, poverty and European, Chinese and American neocolonialism that makes the peoples of the countries of Africa and the Middle East flee to Europe. Therefore, Europe must finally take responsibility and protect these countries from corruption, war and neocolonialism and help them start their economy."""
Migration from countries with incompatible cultural values and ideologies must be limited or stopped in order to ensure social cohesion in Europe. Ideologies and old-fashioned regressive values should have no place in Europe. 
"""Migrants who are already here (legally) must be taught Western values so that they and their families can integrate/asymilate, as the old saying says ""when they are in Rome, do what the Romans do."""""
"""What we are seeing now are the first waves of a human tsunami. In sub-Saharan Africa, over the years the population will have increased to 2 billion people.  That is more than people living in the EU and the US. Today.  At the same time, the population of the EU is shrinking. When we keep the border open, the EU as a viable society will disappear.  There is not much future for young Europeans."""
Entry into the EU without permission automatically excludes a person from any right to receive asylum. 
"""We must put an end to all loopholes, for example by automatically rejecting asylum applications from anyone who illegally enters Europe."""
"""In conclusion, we should say: 'Europeans are going home. Go home, leave all parts of the world where we are doing business, exploiting cheap labor, rare minerals, selling weapons, invading foreign countries and exporting democracy, etc.'"""
"""The EU's real demographic problems must be resolved by promoting procreation and a generous family policy, not through migration. We must celebrate motherhood and mothers. We must realize that raising a child entails serious costs in today's Europe."""
"""Multiculturalism creates chaos wherever it exists. Stockholm in Sweden has become the capital of West rape, and the number of bombs and shots fired in that country as well. France is bordering the civil war, entire territories are no longer under state control. Europe needs to stop migration and asylum indefinitely. We must put our European peoples first, as everyone is doing while our civilization commits suicide on the basis of values imposed by sanctimonious narcissists. """
"""There is nothing wrong with not wanting your continent to turn into chaos and put your people first, every civilization in this world takes that idea as self-evident. We need to negotiate Remigration agreements with third countries to send their nationals back and we need to use Frontex to push any migrants who come to our borders."""
EU leaders do not fulfil their fundamental obligations: to monitor their border and protect their own citizens. Even 30 years after the introduction of Schengen. 
Immigration should not be part of humanitarian aid. Humanitarian aid must be delivered directly to Africa and Asia. The agreement with Turkey should ultimately be abolished.
"""Europe must remain in Europe and citizens must not be subjected to cultural and religious change that they do not want and that is madness. See what Arab or North African countries have become after 1400 years of Islam."""
A humanitarian partnership should be required to help a migrant to enter the EU illegally and provide financial support on decent terms. 
"""A humanitarian partnership that helps a migrant enter the EU illegally should also be brought before the court for not taking the illegals to the nearest safe port. In 90 per cent of cases, the nearest port is in Africa. """
We need to put an end to all funding for NGOs and all migration organisations within the EU. Then we can talk about how to help the people who are already here and how to help the real people in need.
We must agree that people who do not respect our immigration law are detained in repatriation centres.
The country of origin must be absolutely the most important criterion for deciding who we let into our countries. 160 French would remain alive if we put the welfare of ours above the people whose countries the Americans have bombed in pieces.
"""It's time, to be honest about this! Europeans have the right to self-determination like any other country! This is OUR home and a home for all is a home for no one."""
Our European continent is in debt and does not have the resources to care for people who have never paid taxes and continue to ignore our laws! We already have enough poor people in Europe and we have to take care of them!
"""I do not agree to strip people of their right to asylum and a right to live in the EU because they came illegally. Instead, I would suggest that it be easier to migrate legally. That way there would be no need to migrate illegally and risk his life while he does."""
"""The division of refugees is a long-standing plan. But in the end, no group involved agreed to these plans. Some countries don't like these people at all."""
