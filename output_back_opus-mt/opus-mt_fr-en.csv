"""Why should every EU country be sovereign in energy production? In countries too, not all regions are sovereign in this sense. We must take advantage of the geographical potential of the European continent for pragmatic solutions"""
"""Not only to commit, but also to plan. In particular, if an immigrant is caught for a terrorist act, he or she must be permanently expelled from the EU."""
Most experts agree that an EU-wide carbon tax would be an effective way to reduce our CO2 emissions. 
"""In my opinion, it will be essential to impose compensatory levies on products from third countries to ensure that they will not have a competitive advantage."""
"""Finally, the best solution would be a global agreement (as in the OECD and as expected) such as the global minimum tax rate."""
"""That's absolutely true! If the Eurocrats cared about what people wanted, they would ask them. """
"""Affordable and accessible rail travel brings everyone closer, regardless of borders"""
"""We should consider other possibilities for legal entry into the EU. Many people come illegally, because we deny them opportunities to come, stay a little for work or education and maybe come back later. People die because of these absurdities."""
"""I recently read that African families in particular tend to send their smartest and most educated young people abroad to improve the family situation. These people are desperately needed both for the future of their country of origin and for our future. We need qualified and educated people in many sectors, but we send them back to their country of origin, because they were unhappy enough to be refugees."""
"""It must function as with air transport: Book a consistent A to B journey operated by different companies, and make sure that if something goes wrong, there will be a solution (booking,...)."""
Nuclear energy is not green because of radioactive waste.
"""I agree, no one should migrate to a country if they're going to commit a crime."""
"""Nuclear energy is simply too expensive and therefore economically unsustainable. According to RethinkX researchers, we will see a clean energy disruption over the next ten years, which will leave investments in oil, coal and nuclear stranded."""
"""Africa and the Middle East have the highest birth rate in the world. Africa has up to 7 children per woman. The EU has 1.55.  It is this high birth rate that keeps them poor. The EU can hardly do anything about it."""
The EU is not responsible for the whole world.
All refugee camps should be closed. And the illegals went back to the last country they left. 
Helping migrants learn the language and culture of the country in which they live is essential to successful integration. Language and labour market and workplace standards should also be integrated.
Africa is the only continent where the number of young people continues to increase. 
There is no need to discuss what has happened in the past between Africa and Europe. All the slaves and their owners died a long time ago. You can't blame grandkids.
"""If there are language problems, we need to work on national integration systems, for example. in France where English is thought in French. language."""
We already have English as a language of exchange.
"""English is ideal because it is spoken internationally as a language of commerce, travel and political exchange. Esperanto is not."""
Migration is part of the human being and has always taken place throughout history.    
"""The EU needs in a humane, civilized and legal way to manage migration, whether for economic reasons or to obtain international protection."""
EU Member States must stand up together instead of trying to impose burdens on others or external countries.
"""We must accept more immigrants to fight the ageing of the European population. Immigrants are also getting older, but before that, they usually have children."""
"""Paying taxes is not enough, if you want to become a citizen with all the rights you need to fully embrace the country in which you live."""
"""If young Europeans live abroad, they will themselves feel racism in the country where they live."""
"""No duck would want to live with eagles or sparrows.  It's nature, not the desire to think."""
Migrants have a total lack of critical thinking.  
Migrants are willing to risk their lives.
Migrants depend on the social systems of other countries.
Migrants sell drugs.
The EU should recognise that increasing birth rates in Europe and supporting European families to have (plus) children are the most appropriate solution in the long term.
"""In order to increase the birth rate and support young families, Hungary should be an example. We should not rely on migration for that."""
The focus on negative stereotypes of migrants comes mainly from people who do not know Africans or other migrants or refugees. 
"""Migrants have a huge amount of energy, new ideas and cultures. Why this emphasis on imaginary ""takes of control""?"
"""If asylum applications are lodged abroad, the processing costs of asylum seekers for EU taxpayers are reduced."""
"""If asylum applications are lodged from abroad, the humanitarian crisis in the Mediterranean Sea will end."""
"""If asylum applications are lodged from abroad, the security risks for asylum seekers are considerably reduced."""
"""Wall migration is a hybrid war directed against our stability. State actors such as Morocco, Belarus and Turkey have already benefited from mass migration. """
"""Wall migration is a hybrid war directed against our stability. NGOs organize, finance and encourage migration to gain benefits."""
"""Migration has become totally uncontrollable. The EU refuses to see its scale. Hundreds of millions like to migrate. All people without the right language and education. The massive number of immigrants threatens the existence of EU societies, due to crime, poverty and housing shortages."""
 Refugees can obtain a visa from an embassy in one of the 54 African countries. All other immigrants must be returned within one week of arrival.
"""There are members of the European Union who do not want asylum seekers in their country. For example, Denmark returns all Syrens and other Arabs."""
Fear of the unknown is normal behavior. He saved our race from ages when humanity was a simple monkey among others. 
"""In addition, when fear is reinforced by facts such as the increase in violence in all countries where the number of immigrants is high and the rape of women, it is not a problem of ""perception"" but a simple reality."""
Stops all immigration from non-European or non-European countries from the first world to the EU.
"""Instead of trying to stop immigration, we must create a good integration plan while improving living conditions in the 2nd and 3rd countries of the world. This includes the fight for climate justice and the reduction of the unequal distribution of wealth among countries."""
We need rules for integration: integration does not mean abandoning European values and culture.
There must be rules for integration: integration does not mean completely open borders.
I am pleased to see that the idea of combating immigration from non-European countries and non-European countries in the first world continues to be strong. This message must be very clearly communicated in Brussels. 
More non-European immigration. Native Europeans said NO.
European citizens are the future of Europe! 
"""All you have to do is fight to keep the migrants away is very myopic and not historical. By keeping migrants away, the migratory pressure will not ease. What do you propose for next year, in 10 years? """
"""Migration has been a historic fact and prosperous societies have found ways to transform migration into a force. In our case, in order to alleviate the current long-term challenge, we must alleviate the migratory pressure by making it attractive for migrants to stay and help develop their own country. Such a useful project, a European Marshal Plan for Africa would be a good project to invest. The long-term return on investment would be more than financial: a friendly neighbouring continent, good relations, access to the African market and natural resources. This is not a short-term solution. And there is no short-term solution. We have to play the long game!"""
"""Why can't Arab countries welcome refugees from other Arab countries? The same habits, the same religion and they have enough wealth."""
This is the issue of public sector policy and policy development. No objective should be pursued. No problem to solve. I guess that's the nature of the beast. Balancing conflicting interests. 
A humanitarian association that helps a migrant enter the EU illegally should lose its funding by the government/EU.
"""We must stop any immigration from non-European countries or from the first world to the EU. However, if we want to stop this immigration, we must stop its causes. Indeed, it is European, Chinese and American war, poverty and neocolonialism that drive the peoples of the countries of Africa and the Middle East to Europe. Europe must therefore finally assume its responsibilities and protect these countries from corruption, war and neocolonialism and help them start their economies."""
Migration from countries with incompatible cultural values and ideologies should be limited or halted to ensure social cohesion in Europe. Regressive ideologies and outdated values should not have their place in Europe. 
"""The migrants who are already (legally) here should be taught Western values so that they and their families can integrate/assimilate, as the old saying says ""when in Rome, do as the Romans do."""
"""What we see now is the first waves of a human tsunami. In sub-Saharan Africa, the population will have increased over the years to 2.0 billion.  This is more than the people who live in the EU and the US today.  At the same time, the EU population is declining. When we keep the border open, the EU, as a viable society, will disappear.  Not much future for young Europeans."""
Entry into the EU without a permit automatically excludes a person from any right of asylum. 
"""We must put an end to all the shortcomings - for example, automatically reject the asylum applications of anyone who illegally enters Europe."""
"""In conclusion, we should say: ""Europeans are returning home. Go home, leave all regions of the world where we do business, exploit cheap labour, rare minerals, sell weapons, invade foreign countries and export democracy, etc. '"""
"""The real demographic problems of the EU must be solved by encouraging procreation and a generous family policy, not by migration. We have to celebrate motherhood and moms. We must realize that the education of a child entails serious costs in today's Europe."""
"""Multiculturalism creates chaos wherever it exists. Sweden, Stockholm, became the capital of western rape, and the number of bombs and shootings also exploded in that country. France is at the edge of the civil war, whole territories are no longer under the control of the State. Europe must stop migration and asylum indefinitely. We must give priority to our European peoples, as the whole world does while our civilization is committing suicide on the basis of the values imposed by the sacred narcissists. """
"""There is nothing wrong with not wanting your continent to become chaos and put your people first, every civilization in this world takes this idea as obvious. We need to negotiate re-emigration agreements with the 3rd countries to send back their nationals and we need to use Frontex to repel migrants arriving at our borders."""
EU leaders do not carry out their fundamental tasks: to keep their borders and to protect their own citizens. Even 30 years after the introduction of Schengen. 
Immigration should not be part of humanitarian aid. Humanitarian assistance should be provided directly to Africa/Asia. The agreement with Turkey should finally be abolished.
"""Europe must remain Europe, and citizens must not be forced into a cultural and religious change which they do not want and which is foolish. Look at what Arab or North African countries have become, after 1400 years of Islam."""
A humanitarian association that helps a migrant to enter the EU illegally should be obliged to provide financial support under worthy conditions. 
"""A humanitarian association that helps a migrant enter the EU illegally should also be dragged to court for not taking the illegals to the nearest port. In 90 per cent of cases, the nearest port is in Africa. """
"""We must stop funding NGOs and all migration organisations in the EU. So, can we talk about how to help people already here and how to help real people in need."""
We must agree that those who do not comply with our immigration law are being held in repatriation centres.
The country of origin should be the most important criterion in deciding who we allow to enter our countries. 160 French would still be alive if we put the well-being of ourselves above the peoples whose countries the Americans bombed.
 It's time to be honest about it! Europeans have the right to self-determination like all other countries! It's OUR house and a house for everyone is a house for no one.
Our continent in Europe is in debt and has no resources to look after people who have never paid taxes and who continue to despise our laws! We already have enough poor people in Europe and we have to take care of them!
"""I do not agree with depriving people of their right to asylum and their right to live in the EU because they have come illegally. Rather, I suggest facilitating legal migration. In this way, there would be no need to migrate illegally and risk your life while doing so."""
"""The refugee division is a long-debated plan. But in the end, no group involved agrees with these plans. Some countries do not like these people at all. """
