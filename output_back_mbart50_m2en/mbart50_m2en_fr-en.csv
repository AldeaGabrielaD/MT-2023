"""In my opinion, it will be essential to impose countervailing levies on products from third countries to ensure that they do not have a competitive advantage."""
"""Finally, the best solution would be a global agreement (as in the OECD framework and as envisaged) such as the global minimum tax rate."""
"""That's absolutely true! If the Eurocrats cared about what people wanted, they would ask them."""
"""Affordable and accessible rail travel brings everyone closer, regardless of borders"""
"""We should consider other possibilities for legal entry into the EU. Many people come illegally, because we deny them opportunities to come, to stay a little for work or education and maybe come back later. People are dying because of this nonsense."""
"""I have recently read that African families in particular tend to send their brightest and most educated young people abroad to improve the family situation. These people are desperately needed both for the future of their country of origin and for our future. We need skilled and educated people in many sectors, but we are sending these people back to their countries of origin because they were unfortunate enough to be refugees."""
"""It has to work like with air transport: book a consistent journey from A to B operated by different companies, and make sure that if something goes wrong, there will be a solution (booking,...)."""
Nuclear energy is not green because of radioactive waste.
"""I agree, no one should migrate to a country if they are going to commit a crime."""
"""Nuclear energy is simply too expensive and therefore economically unsustainable. According to researchers at RethinkX, we will see a disruption in clean energy over the next ten years, which will leave investments in oil, coal and nuclear unsuccessful."""
"""Africa and the Middle East have the highest birth rate in the world. Africa has up to 7 children per woman. The EU accounts for 1.55.  It is this high birth rate that keeps them poor. The EU can hardly do anything about it."""
The EU is not responsible for the whole world.
All refugee camps should be closed. And the illegals have returned to the last country they left. 
Helping migrants to learn the language and culture of the country in which they live is essential for successful integration. Language and labour market and workplace standards should also be integrated.
Africa is the only continent where the number of young people continues to increase. 
There is no point in discussing what has happened in the past between Africa and Europe. All slaves and their owners died long ago. You cannot blame grandchildren.
"""If there are language problems, we have to work on national integration systems, for example. in France where English is thought of in French. language."""
We already have English as a language of exchange.
"""English is ideal because it is spoken internationally as a language of commerce, travel and political exchange. Esperanto is not."""
Migration is part of human beings and has always taken place throughout history.    
"""The EU needs a humane, civilised and legal way of managing migration, whether for economic reasons or for international protection."""
The EU Member States must stand together instead of trying to impose burdens on others or on external countries.
"""We must accept more immigrants in order to combat the ageing of the European population. Immigrants are also aging, but before that they usually have children."""
"""The payment of taxes is not enough if you want to become a citizen with all the rights you need to fully embrace the country in which you live."""
"""If young Europeans live abroad, they will themselves feel racism in the country where they live."""
"""No duck wants to live with eagles or monkeys.  It is nature, not the desire to think."""
Migrants have a total lack of critical thinking.  
Migrants willingly risk their lives.
Migrants depend on the social systems of other countries.
Migrants sell drugs.
The EU should recognise that increasing birth rates in Europe and supporting European families to have (more) children is the most appropriate long-term solution.
"""In order to increase the birth rate and support young families, Hungary should be an example. We should not rely on migration for this."""
The emphasis on negative stereotypes of migrants is mainly due to people who do not know Africans or other migrants or refugees. 
"""Migrants have an enormous amount of energy, new ideas and cultures. Why this emphasis on imaginary ""takeovers""?"
"""If asylum applications are lodged abroad, the costs of processing asylum seekers for EU taxpayers are reduced."""
"""If asylum applications are lodged from abroad, the humanitarian crisis in the Mediterranean ends."""
"""If asylum applications are lodged from abroad, the risks to the security of asylum seekers are considerably reduced."""
"""Mass migration is a hybrid war against our stability. State actors such as Morocco, Belarus and Turkey have already benefited from mass migration.”"
"""Mass migration is a hybrid war against our stability. NGOs organise, finance and encourage migration in order to obtain benefits."""
"""Migration has become totally uncontrollable. The EU refuses to see its scope. Hundreds of millions like to migrate. All people without proper language and education. The massive number of immigrants is threatening the existence of EU societies, due to crime, poverty and housing shortages."""
 Refugees can obtain a visa from an embassy in one of the 54 African countries. All other immigrants must be returned within one week of arrival.
"""There are members of the European Union who do not want asylum seekers in their countries. For example, Denmark is returning all Syrians and other Arabs."""
Fear of the unknown is a normal behaviour. He saved our race from ages gone by when humanity was a simple monkey among others. 
"""Furthermore, when fear is reinforced by facts such as the increase in violence in all countries with high numbers of immigrants and the rape of women, it is not a problem of 'perception' but a simple reality."""
Stop all immigration from non-European or non-First World countries to the EU.
"""Instead of trying to stop immigration, we need to create a good integration plan while improving living conditions in the 2nd and 3rd countries of the world. This includes fighting for climate justice and reducing the unequal distribution of wealth between countries."""
We need rules for integration: integration does not mean abandoning European values and culture.
There must be rules for integration: integration does not mean completely open borders.
I am pleased to see that the idea of combating all immigration from non-European and non-First World countries continues to be strong. This message must be communicated very clearly to Brussels. 
More non-European immigration. The native Europeans said NO.
European citizens are the future of Europe! 
"""Just fighting to keep migrants out is very myopic and unhistorical. By keeping migrants out, the migratory pressure will not lessen. What do you propose for next year, 10 years from now?"""
"""Migration has been historic and prosperous societies have found ways to turn migration into strength. In our case, in order to alleviate the current long-term challenge, we must alleviate the migratory pressure by making it attractive for migrants to stay and help develop their own countries. Such a useful project, a European flagship plan for Africa, would be a good project to invest in. The long-term return on investment would be more than financial: a friendly neighbouring continent, good relations, access to the African market and natural resources. This is not a short-term solution. And there is no short-term solution. We have to play the long game!"""
"""Why can't Arab countries receive refugees from other Arab countries? The same habits, the same religion and they have enough wealth."""
This is the issue of public sector policy and policy development. No objectives should be pursued. No problem to be solved. I suppose that's the nature of the beast. Balancing conflicting interests. 
A humanitarian association that helps a migrant to enter the EU illegally should lose its funding from the government/EU.
"""We must stop all immigration to the EU from non-European or non-First World countries. However, if we want to stop this immigration, we must stop the causes. Indeed, it is war, poverty and neo-colonialism in Europe, China and the United States that are driving people from the countries of Africa and the Middle East to Europe. Europe must therefore finally assume its responsibilities and protect these countries from corruption, war and neo-colonialism and help them start their economies."""
Migration from countries with incompatible cultural values and ideologies should be limited or stopped in order to ensure social cohesion in Europe. Regressive outdated ideologies and values should have no place in Europe. 
"""The migrants who are already (legally) here should be taught Western values so that they and their families can integrate/ assimilate, as the old saying goes, 'when in Rome, do like the Romans'."
"""What we are seeing now are the first waves of a human tsunami. In sub-Saharan Africa, the population will have increased over the years to reach 2.0 billion.  It is more than the people who live today in the EU and the United States.  At the same time, the population of the EU is decreasing. When we keep the border open, the EU, as a viable society, will disappear.  Not much of a future for young Europeans."""
Entry into the EU without a permit automatically excludes a person from any right of asylum. 
"'We must put an end to all loopholes - for example, automatically rejecting asylum applications from anyone who enters Europe illegally.'"
"""In conclusion, we should say: 'Europeans are returning home. Go home, leave all the regions of the world where we do business, exploit cheap labour, rare minerals, sell arms, invade foreign countries and export democracy, etc.'"""
"""The EU's demographic problems, which are real, must be solved by promoting reproduction and a generous family policy, not by migration. We must celebrate motherhood and mothers. We must realise that educating a child carries serious costs in today's Europe."""
"""Multiculturalism creates chaos wherever it exists. Sweden, Stockholm, has become the rape capital of the West, and the number of bombs and gunshots has also exploded in that country. France is on the brink of civil war, entire territories are no longer under State control. Europe must stop migration and asylum indefinitely. We must give priority to our European peoples, as the whole world is doing at a time when our civilisation is committing suicide on the basis of the values imposed by the sacred narcissists."""
"""There is nothing wrong with not wanting your continent to become chaos and putting your people first, every civilization in the world takes this idea for granted. We must negotiate resettlement agreements with third countries to return their nationals and we must use Frontex to push back migrants arriving at our borders."""
The EU's leaders are not performing their fundamental tasks: keeping their borders and protecting their own citizens. Even 30 years after the introduction of Schengen. 
Immigration should not be part of humanitarian aid. Humanitarian assistance should be provided directly to Africa/Asia. The agreement with Turkey should finally be abolished.
"""Europe must remain Europe and citizens must not be forced into a cultural and religious change which they do not want and which is nonsensical. Look at what the Arab or North African countries have become, after 1400 years of Islam."""
A humanitarian association that helps a migrant to enter the EU illegally should be obliged to provide financial support on dignified terms. 
"""A humanitarian association that helps a migrant enter the EU illegally should also be brought to court for failing to take the illegals to the nearest port. In 90% of cases, the closest port is in Africa.”"
"""We must stop funding NGOs and all migration organisations in the EU. So can we talk about how to help people already here and how to help the real people in need."""
We must agree that persons who do not comply with our immigration law are detained in repatriation centres.
The country of origin should absolutely be the most important criterion in deciding who we allow to enter our countries. 160 The French would still be alive if we put the welfare of ourselves above the peoples whose countries the Americans bombed.
 It is time to be honest about this! Europeans have the right to self-determination like all other countries! This is OUR home and a home for everyone is a home for everyone.
Our European continent is indebted and does not have the resources to deal with people who have never paid taxes and who continue to flout our laws! We already have enough poor people in Europe and we must deal with them!
"""I do not agree with depriving people of their right to asylum and their right to live in the EU because they have come illegally. Rather, I suggest facilitating legal migration. In this way, there would be no need to migrate illegally and risk your life while doing so."""
"""The division of refugees is a long-debated plan. But in the end, no group involved agrees with these plans. Some countries don't like these people at all."""
