"'Moreover, when fear is reinforced by facts such as the increase in violence in all countries with a high number of immigrants and rapes of women, it is not a problem of 'perception', but a simple reality.'"
Stop all immigration from non-European or non-First World countries to the EU.
"""Instead of trying to stop immigration, we need to create a good integration plan and at the same time improve living conditions in the countries of the 2nd and 3rd world. This includes the fight for climate justice and a reduction in the unequal distribution of wealth between countries.'"
There must be some rules for integration:Integration does not mean abandoning European values and culture.
There must be some rules for integration: Integration does not mean completely open borders.
I am pleased to see that the idea of tackling all immigration from non-European or non-First World countries remains strong. This message must be conveyed very clearly to Brussels. 
No more non-European immigration. The natives of Europe have said NO.
European citizens are the future of Europe! 
"""Just arguing to keep migrants out is very short-sighted and unhistorical. In keeping migrants out, migratory pressure will not diminish. So what do you suggest for next year, in 10 years' time?"
"""Migration has been a fact of history and successful societies have found ways to turn migration into fortress. In our case, in order to alleviate the current long-term challenge, we need to alleviate the migratory pressure by making it attractive for migrants to stay in their place and help develop their own countries. Such a useful project, a European Maritime Plan for Africa, would be a good project to invest in. The long-term return on investment would be more than financial: a friendly neighbouring continent, good relations, access to the African market and natural resources. That is not a short-term solution. And there is no short-term solution. We have to play the long game!'"
"""Why can Arab countries not accommodate refugees from other Arab countries? The same habits, religion and have enough wealth.'"
"is the theme in public sector policy and policy formulation. Objectives will not be pursued. There are no problems to be solved. I suppose that is the nature of the beast. The Committee recommends that the State party take all necessary measures to ensure the full implementation of the present recommendations, inter alia, by transmitting them to the members of the Council of Ministers, the Parliament, the Parliamentary Assembly and the Senate, the Parliamentary Assembly, the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Ministers, the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe, the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe, the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe, the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe, the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe, the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe, the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe, the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe, the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe, the Parliamentary Assembly of the European Union, the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe, the Parliamentary Assembly of "
A humanitarian association that helps a migrant to enter the EU illegally should lose its government/EU funding.
"""We must stop all immigration from non-European or non-First World countries to the EU. However, if we want to stop this immigration, we must stop its causes. In fact, it is war, poverty and European, Chinese and American neo-colonialism that are driving the peoples of the countries of Africa and the Middle East to flee to Europe. Europe must therefore finally take responsibility and protect these countries from corruption, war and neo-colonialism and help them start their economy.'"
The migration of countries with incompatible cultural values and ideologies must be limited or stopped in order to guarantee social cohesion in Europe. Antiquated ideologies and regressive values should have no place in Europe. 
"'The migrants who are already here (legally) must be taught Western values so that they and their families can integrate/accommodate, as the old saying goes, 'when they are in Rome, do what the Romans do'."
"""What we are seeing now are the first waves of a human tsunami. In sub-Saharan Africa, over the years the population will have increased to 2 billion people.  That is more than people living in the EU and the US. The Committee recommends that the State party take all necessary measures to ensure the full implementation of the present recommendations, inter alia, by transmitting them to the members of the Council of Ministers, the Parliament, the Parliamentary Assembly and the National Assembly, for appropriate consideration and further action.  At the same time, the EU population is shrinking. When we keep the border open, the EU as a viable society will disappear.  There is not much future for young Europeans.'"
Entering the EU without a permit automatically excludes a person from any right to asylum. 
"'We must put an end to all loopholes, for example by automatically rejecting asylum applications from anyone entering Europe illegally.'"
"'In conclusion, we should say: 'Europeans are going home. He goes home, leaves all the parts of the world where we are doing business, exploiting cheap labour, rare minerals, selling arms, invading foreign countries and exporting democracy, etc. '"""
"""The EU's demographic problems, which are real, must be solved by promoting procreation and a generous family policy, not through migration. We must celebrate motherhood and motherhood. We must realise that bringing up a child entails serious costs in today's Europe.'"
"""Multiculturalism creates chaos wherever it exists. Stockholm in Sweden has become the rape capital of the West, and the number of bombs and shootings has also increased in that country. France is on the brink of civil war, entire territories are no longer under state control. Europe needs to stop migration and asylum indefinitely. We must put our European peoples first, just as everyone else is doing while our civilisation commits suicide on the basis of values imposed by sanctimonious narcissists.'"
"""There is nothing wrong with not wanting your continent to become chaos and putting your people first, every civilization in this world takes that idea as obvious. We need to negotiate immigration agreements with third countries to send their nationals back and we need to use Frontex to push any migrants who come to our borders.'"
The leaders of the EU are not fulfilling their fundamental obligations: to monitor their borders and to protect their own citizens. Even 30 years after the introduction of Schengen. 
Immigration must not be part of humanitarian aid. Humanitarian aid must be delivered directly to Africa and Asia. The agreement with Turkey should ultimately be abolished.
"'Europe must remain in Europe and not impose on its citizens a cultural and religious change that they do not want and that is madness. Look at what the Arab or North African countries have become, after 1400 years of Islam.'"
A humanitarian association helping a migrant to enter the EU illegally should be required to provide financial support on decent terms. 
"""A humanitarian association that helps a migrant to enter the EU illegally should also be sued for failing to bring the illegals to the nearest safe port. In 90% of cases, the closest port is in Africa. """
We must put an end to all funding for NGOs and all migration organisations within the EU. Then we can talk about how to help the people who are already here and how to help the real people in need.
We must agree that people who do not respect our immigration law are detained in repatriation centres.
The country of origin must be absolutely the most important criterion for deciding who we allow to enter our countries. 160 French people would still be alive if we put the welfare of our own people above the people whose countries the Americans have bombed to pieces.
""" It's time to be honest about this! Europeans have the right to self-determination like any other country! This is OUR home and a home for all is a home for no one.'"
Our European continent is in debt and does not have the resources to care for people who have never paid taxes and continue to ignore our laws! We already have enough poor people in Europe and we must take care of them!
"""I do not agree with depriving people of their right to asylum and a right to live in the EU because they came illegally. Instead, I would suggest that it is easier to migrate legally. In this way, there would be no need to migrate illegally and risk your life while you are doing so.'"
"""The division of refugees is a long-standing plan. But in the end, none of the groups involved agreed with these plans. Some countries do not like these people at all. """
