"Because of inactive lifestyle and stressful lives, many people are receiving lifestyle diseases such as diabetes, hypertension, etc. Fit India Movement can encourage people to consume healthy food and maintain physical and mental fitness.”"
"“With high-quality advertising and marketing practices, food wasting manufacturers are manipulating children to buy their food. This Fit India movement will make children think about the negative consequences of food wasting. As a result, this movement will encourage children to consume healthy foods.”"
"“Some parents put too much stress on their children to study. They send their children to school after school or simply make them sitting to do the tasks forgetting the importance of free time to play. This movement has the potential to change ideas and, as a result, they can encourage their children to go out to play.”"
"“This movement has the potential to make more people embrace forms of traditional Indian martial art such as Kathi Samu, Musti Yudha, etc, and forms of traditional dance and even healthy Indian snack. And as a subproduct, this can lead to the creation of some jobs.”"
"The motivation to maintain suitability should start from childhood. But in India, many schools lack gaming parks. The lack of play parks can push children to turn to inactive lifestyle.”"
"“The India Fit movement cannot reach people below the poverty threshold. To maintain a healthy lifestyle, both physical activity and nutrient food are needed. But in India, still many people are malnutrition and some people do not have access to safe drinking water. So, without solving the issue of poverty and the lack of access to nutritional food at affordable prices, a portion of people in India will not be able to take advantage of this movement.”"
"“Some people are already focusing on fitness. We can observe this with the growing number of fitness startups. This is a small percentage of people. In general, many people want to maintain an active lifestyle, but all they need is some encouragement. So, this movement constantly reminds people of focusing on fitness goals just as Swachh Bharat reminds us of the importance of keeping our environment clean.”"
"“Since the invention of machines, the value of workers is decreasing. They are made to work to support machines. As a result, work rotates around machines and not humans. Workers are forced to work continuously with the machine. """
"“People are engaging in trolling and cyberbullying. Sinking behind devices is giving them the courage to harass other people, who cannot make face to face. This is the deterioration of moral values.”"
"“Some companies are building strategies to use their applications for a longer period of time, to keep us dependent on their applications and devices so that they can display advertisements to us. And they can also use our data to manipulate our decisions for their profits. These strategies are turning humans into fair targets.”"
"“Industrialization has increased working hours. Workers had to face unhuman conditions. Human beings cannot work and focus continuously as machines. So far, we have technological devices to verify how many hours we actually work. Some companies want to be connected 24 hours a day through email and messages. This makes people feel less human.”"
"“Our decision-making capabilities are also influenced since we now ask search engines to know what’s better. We rely on the Internet knowledge base even at the offices to finish the work at hand. This affects the cognitive abilities (think, read, learn, remember, and reason), which is an essential quality of human beings."
"“Many face-to-face communications are also replaced by virtual interactions. Many people now live in virtual houses, which is the smartphone. As the need to speak with each other is decreasing, the ability to communicate with each other, which is a basic quality of living beings, is decreasing.”"
"“We are increasingly dependent on technology devices to guide us. For example, we keep memory on smartphones and Google questions for answers. We are outsourcing the activities that require intelligence to technology. Thinking, remembering things and analyzing are essential qualities of human beings. Too much dependence on technology makes us less human.”"
"“Using technology, people areining and improving relationships with their friends, family and relatives. Many people are also connecting to each other to help those in need and inspire each other. So now we have better tools to build human connections.”"

"“This draft law has conferred exclusive powers to the National Investigation Agency (NIA). The NIA may take any person under their custody under UAPA without taking the preventive permission from the state government. This is against federalism, which is guaranteed by the Constitution of India.”"
"“Labeling organizations such as terrorist organizations and people that label as terrorists are very different. If a person is named terrorist, he will have to face social exclusion and will be deprived of subsistence opportunities even if he has demonstrated the opposite. The consequences will be irreversible. For example, in 2016 alone, 67% of cases ended with failure, which means they are likely to be innocent.”"
"“If someone is booked under UAPA, the burden to prove their innocence is on them. This new amendment allows the government to acquire property.” So how will they pay the legal expenses to prove their innocence, if they are unjustly accused?”"
"“This will provide more police powers to the central government. The provision of calling individuals as terrorists can be abused. For example, recently several civil activists are called Urban Naxals. If someone opposes the government, he will be vulnerable to be trapped as a terrorist. Because this amendment has made it easier to label anyone as a terrorist.”"
"“There is a growing threat of solitary wolf terrorism. Solitary terrorists have no association with terrorist organizations, but they commit terrorist attacks on their own. This new UAPA amendment has the potential to stop solitary wolf terrorism.”"
"“To avoid human rights violations, a four-step examination is added. Designing individuals as terrorists has not begun from India. The United States, the European Union and China also have this provision.”"
"So far, only organizations have been designated as terrorist organizations, but not as individuals. The escape in this is the individuals of banned organizations are forming new organizations and carrying out terrorist activities. This law amendment for illegal activities (Prevention) Act allows the government to designate individuals as terrorists, so terrorist attacks can be avoided.”"
"“It is necessary to act firmly against terrorism in the presence of increasing threats from terrorists. So, strengthening UAPA is necessary.”"
"""Today, India does not have a well-developed infrastructure to ensure data security. On the other hand, developed countries already have efficient infrastructure. So, running towards data localization cannot be a wise step. Because without efficient infrastructure, data is subject to computer attacks. And the risk here is serious because they are financial data. But as the laws are made, it is a big challenge to develop efficient infrastructure at a faster pace.”"
"“Data storage in India leads to higher operating costs for payment system operators. Because in other countries they have more economical alternatives. And also for cross-border transactions, they need to store the data in two points, which increases costs. These additional costs are likely to be transferred to consumers.”"
Data localization laws determine the creation of multiple data centers locally. This will create many jobs and greatly help the country’s economy. It will also encourage innovation in the industry with cheap solutions.
"During the investigation of the crimes, there will be the need to access the payment data. If the data is stored abroad, it is very difficult to obtain permission from that country for access to the data. This causes delays in the resolution of crimes. If the data is stored here within our country, this problem will be avoided.”"
"“India is a big consumer market for many foreign companies. Thus, India and other developing countries are realizing the economic value of data and the importance of data localization. With the localization of the data, national companies and the country’s economy will benefit. And we can also guarantee data security.”"
"“Data is considered a new form of wealth [49]. In general, companies use data to understand consumer needs and also to influence their behavior. New products can be developed by analysing data to meet consumer needs. The data has an economic value. In general, developed countries are taking advantage of this opportunity with their well-developed infrastructure.”"
"“We are in a globalized world. Currently, the world is running on the free flow of people, goods, services and data. Data localization laws appear to fall into protection policies, which constitute a threat to the free flow of data.”"
"“The United States is against data localization laws. Recently at the G20 summit, U.S. President Donald Trump spoke against data localization. Its position is natural because it increases the operating costs of U.S. companies. The bilateral relations between India and the United States are important for both countries because we are engaged in the export and import of IT services, professionals and goods, etc. So, imposing laws on data localization without threatening Indo-US relations is another challenge.”"
We can guarantee the privacy of data by locating the data.
Localization of the data may involve the supervision of the government of its citizens.
"“Data localization is important for data sovereignty, which means that citizens’ data should be owned by their respective governments and not by other countries.”"
The law is very clear that the RTI does not only take care of government bodies. It is also for non-governmental organizations that are substantially funded and controlled by the government. Subsidies (including tax exemptions) that political parties enjoy are therefore substantially funded by the government.
"“Political parties are independent bodies, they should not be responsible to the public. They were not established by the Constitution or by an act of Parliament.”"
"“The RTI law stipulates that wherever there is public interest, such organizations must be transparent and fall within the law. Today there are a number of private, partially funded or fully-funded organizations; schools, hospitals, etc. They are under the RTI law and not just the governmental organizations.”"
There are appropriate provisions in the income tax law and with the electoral commission so that people can have all the information they want.
"The RTI law contains the provisions referred to in Section 8 referring to the concept of competitive interest. Certain exemptions are provided in cases where it can be demonstrated that the disclosure of the information may harm the competitive advantage of the party. This is not only a problem with political parties, but also a lot of governments and private bodies.”"
"It is believed that political financing is the source of corruption. Citizens have the right to know where political parties collect these funds, how they spend them and the basis of their decisions. Chronist capitalism will be strongly blocked if political parties are subjected to the RTI law.”"
"“According to the IT law, political parties do not need to reveal donations that they get below INR 20,000. An informal study conducted in 2010 on 6 key political parties shows that they raised Rs 700 crore. 95% of the amount was increased with amounts below Rs 20,000. There is a great chance that political parties will use this escape to their advantage.”"
"“The political parties declare certain promises in their manifestations. After being elected, citizens have the right to know why the promises made by political parties have not been fulfilled.”"
Political parties are at the heart of democracy. The political parties continue to form the government. Government policies are then governed by the ideology of the parties. It is therefore essential that political parties enter the RTI.
"“If political parties fall within the RTI, this will affect their regular internal functioning. Rivals can use RTIs for mutual manipulation. Moreover, since political parties are not directly connected to the public, a RTI would not be valid.”"
"“The Indians as a whole consider educational institutions as machines for work, we expect to get unemployed and get out with employment. We do not realize that we will have to upgrade our skills to become worthy of employment. That’s why more than 80% of engineers are unemployed and the figures are even worse for non-engineers.”"
"""Al we have established institutions at national level over the past 40 years, we have not invested inining their standards. Funding is needed for quality education. Even the best Indian institutions lack adequate infrastructure, laboratories, resources, etc. And even all that is available is only for the good of passing students in the exam and inactive sitting for the rest of the time.”"
"Today, no problem has a single solution and no new technology is linked to a single discipline. We need more input from multiple disciplines and our institutions have failed to do so."
"""Indian students perform brilliantly when they go to different countries in the field of research. This means we don’t lack talent, we lack infrastructure and a healthy environment for our affiliated minds.”"
"“We didn’t pay our teachers on the scale of what their counterparts earn in other countries. As a result, people are reluctant to the idea of teaching as a career. We also failed to attract successful foreign faculty to our institutions.”"
"“To excellence in anything takes time. Through the degree, students acquire so much knowledge in the relevant field. So, it’s easier for employers to train these students for industrial needs.”"
Any skills can be learned and mastered even if we don’t have a degree in this. Programming is no exception.
"""Even if someone has a degree in computer science, they have to learn so many things to enter IT work, because there is a gap between industrial standards and the skills that are taught at the college of engineering. Furthermore, since technology is constantly evolving, even if someone has prepared for industrial standards in his graduation, he must learn the new technologies continuously to remain relevant in the labour market. So, as the learning curve will be there also for IT students, students from non-IT background can also learn these things and can enter IT jobs.”"
"“The number of IT jobs is growing at a fast pace due to the technological revolution. So there will be more jobs in the field of information technologies. And if the recruiters are very strict about the degree, they could lose a large pool of talents, which are of a non-IT background. """
"“Now, we have so many online courses platforms through which we can learn almost any skills from experts. We can also get certificates if we pass the tests. So, as Tim Cook said, a 4-year diploma seems old and traditional. """
"“In many engineering colleges in India, we can easily pass subjects even if they don’t have much knowledge in those subjects. This is why many companies are unable to find the right talent even though there are so many eligible graduates. So, the desire to become an expert in the industry is more important than a degree. """
"""If a non-IT student has chosen to start a career in the field of IT, the efforts they will put into effect for the degree will go away."""
"Although new programming languages are replacing the old, the basic concepts are the same for almost all programming languages. So, whoever has a degree in coding will have an advantage compared to the student from a non-IT background.”"
"“People change their careers even after working in a field for several years because our interests change. So, when someone can do this while having so many personal responsibilities, it’s much easier for young people to learn a new skill.”"
"Variable pay increases the productivity of employees. High-performance individuals feel well compensated and rewarded for their efforts, while the less-performance individuals feel also motivated to improve.”"
"“In variable salary schemes, employees feel satisfied and motivated with their work. They feel an active part of the organization, the organization recognizes them as part of its growth and appreciates their efforts.”"
"“The variable salary helps keep employees valuable. This helps to maintain a good talent for long periods of time and thus, less expenses for the acquisition of new talents. This provides stability to the organization.”"
"""It has been seen that it is difficult to keep employees in weak times when they are on variable salary schemes. Workers who receive commissions do well when the business is good, but they do bad when the business is bad. In slow business times, even the best sellers may have difficulty making enough sales to earn a decent life. If the market is slow and commissioned workers can earn enough, they can look for other job opportunities. In poor times, fixed wages can be more efficient to prevent employees from leaving for other opportunities.”"
"Variable wages can lead to unhealthy competition among employees. They are less willing to help each other. Team cooperation can be negatively influenced. In the long run, relationships between colleagues can become loving. While, in fixed wage schemes, employees are able to maintain cordial relationships in the office.”"
"“Mostly, sales jobs have a variable component. This could have a negative impact on employees’ attitude towards customers. They can force customers irrationally only to make profits for themselves. They could overestimate the price for customers only to make more profits. Meanwhile, an employee with a fixed salary would maintain healthy and positive relationships with customers, finding the right balance in their approach.”"
"“The enormous data we produce every day is analyzed and inserted into our devices through algorithms that end up giving more and more control of our lives to gadgets. We may feel that we receive all of these services for free, but they come at the expense of our precious time and attention.”"
"“With all the data and algorithms our apps and gadgets, without our conscious knowledge, are making decisions for us. The decision-making process is one of the qualities that made humans different from others.”"
"“After a 10-hour daily turn from Monday to Friday most of us prefer to stay at home during the holidays. We are surrounded by laptops, TVs and mobile and we use them in cycles for Netflix, sports, social media, etc. (Thinking that we are relaxing) rather than going out. We prefer and are more comfortable with online chat rather than talking to people seriously. Today there are fewer significant reports due to all the factors above. We’ve begun to prefer isolation.”"
"“Nuclear technology is a very efficient alternative to non-renewable energy resources. However, we have chosen to go forward with more and more types of nuclear tests. The same applies to almost every other invention. Similarly, although initially, AI promised a better life for us, because of AI, we began to lose our basic human qualities.”"
"“We have begun to lose our basic human habits and instincts, and they are actually governed by devices and applications.”"
"“As Yuval Noah Harari says, what we need now is morality and spirituality. Morality is to reduce suffering in the world. And spirituality is to ask and seek answers. Religions provide us with only answers and no scope of questions.”"
"“Religion has served its purpose to unite people, create structures in society and develop trust and cooperation. But in the 21st century, we are prospering towards objective reality, and religion is an inter-subjective reality and now the only thing it does is to create differences in the world, wash your brain, develop anger for other beliefs, and provide rituals that are just scratched to become a good person. (A Muslim can pray 5 times a day; a Hindu can pray every day for hours in temples; a Christian can go to church every day, but still, be involved in immoral activities.)"
"“In the past, everything unknown had to do with religious beliefs. But now science and technology have dominated everything. We know the causes of drought, earthquakes, wind storms, etc. They are scientific phenomena and no longer the anger of the gods.”"
"""Because of their technological nature, new banks do not need physical banking branches, which helps them to save on the general costs (the cost of management of the activity). Therefore, new banks are able to offer customers lower rates and higher interest rates on control and savings accounts.”"
"“People rely so much on new banks because they don’t have a physical presence, which makes them a risk for customers in case of problems or challenges. Customer service in person can seem more reliable to customers.”"
The technological literacy is still very low in India. Traditional banks can meet the banking needs of less technologically experienced customers or people in rural areas of the country who prefer face-to-face interaction with the manager.
"“Commercial banks contribute to the creation of credit, which leads to an increase in production, employment and spending for consumers, which contributes to the growth of the economy.”"
"“Since new banks are completely digital, they operate 24 hours a day and their services can be accessible at any time. They are easy to access from anywhere through a smartphone.”"
"“Fintech companies can open new-specialized banks that address a specific type of customer needs. For example, LXME aims to become the first Indian Neo Bank for Women, which will offer product solutions that meet women’s specific financial needs and emotional preferences.”"
"“5G in the banking sector will bring the very necessary financial inclusion to rural and remote populations of India, for which access to a physical bank is not possible.”"
"“The low 5G latency will allow the inclusion of education in the remote areas of India, where children will be able to access high quality education at home without any delay in networking between them and their favorite tutor. In addition, 5G will allow us to use new-age technologies such as AR and VR for more engaging learning in schools and colleges.”"
"“5G will enormously increase the number of networks that can be connected by managing up to a trillion Internet of Things terminals, which will allow machines and humans to communicate with each other without continuity, making business more efficient and reducing the possibility of errors.”"
"“The government will be able to improve its governance and give impulse to its digital India initiative, which aims to ensure that public fund services are made available electronically to citizens, making the country equipped with digital powers in the technology sector.”"
Hydrogen is inflammatory and can cause fires or explosions. So it’s not completely sure yet.”
"“If hydrogen fuel production uses fossil fuels, this can be counterproductive. So, using renewable energies to produce hydrogen fuel is important.”"
"Vehicles with hydrogen fuel cells do not issue greenhouse gases. This helps to fight climate change. Since many countries opt for the energy transition, clean hydrogen fuel vehicles along with other alternative fuel vehicles can open the way to sustainable transportation. Moreover, as these vehicles do not issue greenhouse gases like carbon dioxide, they can greatly reduce air pollution.”"
"“Fossil fuel prices continue to rise. So, if other hydrogen vehicles enter the market, the price of fossil fuels can decrease.”"
"Hydrogen vehicles are much more silent than fossil fuels. Thus, they can also reduce sound pollution.”"
"“If hydrogen fuel burns into the air, it can increase global warming.”"
"“Thro the pandemic period, social media has helped people maintain their social life.Social media has made it possible to stay always in contact with friends and care people. We can easily know what is happening in their lives. It allowed us to communicate with more people at the same time by sharing posts.”"
"Because of social media, we now have the opportunity to connect with many people, even if they don’t live in our area. Before social media, we could interact with people from our place or from the places we go.”"
"“Following friends on social media and not communicating with them privately, we can only know the things they post on their accounts. Maybe we don’t know much about what’s really happening in their lives. This means that we will not have significant ties with friends. The convenience of contacting people online has made us prefer to meet them outside.”"
"“Some people now have social anxiety because they don’t have enough face-to-face interactions. When we avoid talking to people for a long time, we automatically develop a fear of engaging in small talks.”"
Surrender on social media is a major threat. It is influencing the self-esteem of many people and is also making them avoid forming social ties.
"""In the book Geni, it was said that in the next decade we could see more young people who know only the right emoji for a situation but not the right facial expression. This can become true if we prefer virtual life than real life.”"
"“Through narrow communities or micro-communities based on shared interests on social media along with private messaging, social media has given us the opportunity to build true and own connections with people with whom we can truly connect.”"
"""The NEET examination standardizes the entry criterion for medical education throughout the country. As a high score is required to enter government medical universities, the exam ensures meritocracy.”"
"But every year less than 20% of students pass the exam. From this, it is obvious that the quality of medical education in other countries where Indian students are studying is not at the level of medical education in India. So it is very important to take measures to provide convenient and high quality medical education in India.”"
"“Because the exam requires further studies, coaching centers are taking advantage of the situation and are charging rupee lakhs for training for the NEET exam. So, because of this, students who cannot afford coaching are in disadvantage.”"
"“Students work hard to score well in class 12 exam, but all that hard work is not recognized. And only the NEET score is considered for entrance to the medical college, which is very unfair. In addition, the NEET exam is mainly based on the CBSE curriculum. So, the State Council students need to study additional things to get a good score on the exam.”"
"""A high score in the NEET exam is required to get admission to government medical colleges in India. It costs about 1.25 Rs Crores to study at private medical universities in India. So, many students are forced to go to other countries such as China, Ukraine, Russia, the Philippines, etc. To pursue medical education. In those countries, medical education costs around Rs.35 lakhs. In addition, they allow students with low NEET scores, but above cut-off scores.”"
Some people in the light of the moon to pursue their passion when the earnings from their passion cannot replace the salary from their main job. Several entrepreneurs take this way and leave their job once they earn enough from their new.
"“As from a study published by the Academy of Management Journal in 2021, moonlighting can provide a sense of control and motivation, which can improve the productivity of employees.”"
"“The sudden dismissals by various companies, especially during the pandemic, have caused fear in many employees. And therefore several people took part in side concerts or a second job as a security network in case they were dismissed.”"
Moonlighting can help improve your skills. Some people want to learn new skills other than what they are working on in their primary work. This can help them develop skills in their field. Some might get bored with monotonous jobs and then take the second job to learn new skills and then make their days exciting.
Companies are afraid of theft of sensitive information and data and the possibility of sharing them with their competing companies.
Some managers are concerned that employees who at the light of the moon cannot be productive in their primary work due to fatigue and increased stress. There are also concerns about working for other companies during the office hours of my primary work.
"“In general, companies provide various benefits to employees such as insurance fund, health insurance, etc. So, they think it’s unfair when their employees focus their energy and time on a second job, which does not provide one of these benefits.”"
"A cash-free economy saves so much money for governments because printing money, and sending money to banks requires money and human resources. It will also be eliminated the need to buy or rent land for bancomat. International payments will also be easier because there is no need to change currency.”"
Cash-free transactions leave digital footprints of financial transactions. They can be used to track illegal activities. 
COVID Pandemic has increased the number of cash-free transactions. They can prevent the spread of infectious diseases.
"“Money-free transactions are registered by the banks. Thus, the data will reveal the critical data of people regarding where they spend the money. The government can easily access the data of anyone. It can lead to mass monitoring programs. This is against the right to privacy. Money gives us anonymity.”"
A cash-free economy will increase the number of cyber crimes.
Technical issues in the banking sector can stop access to our money. This can interfere with our daily lives.
"“The refugees are escaped by force. They flee their country for various reasons, such as violence, human rights violations, war, persecution of minorities, etc. They often face life threats in their countries of origin. They leave their homes and everything else looking for a safer place to live in.”"
"""Today, many countries reject refugees by saying they represent an economic or security threat. Only a few countries, including Lebanon, Jordan, Turkey and Liberia, accept the majority of refugees. Some host countries are forcefully sending refugees to their country of origin saying that the situation in their country of origin is safe. Many refugees who have been sent so have suffered brutal violence and some people have even disappeared.”"
All countries should share responsibility for refugees. Refugees should be resettled without delay. They should be equipped with skills development courses and job opportunities to help them live a decent life.
"“A weak global response is worsening the situation of refugees. The international community should help to reconstruct the countries devastated by the war, from which refugees come, so that refugees can get a safe and decent return. Refugees should not be sent by force to their country of origin.”"
"“Many developed countries are spending so much money to protect their borders, but they are not spending money to protect the lives of refugees. More funding is needed to protect refugees.”"
"“In general, some teachers punish students, who don’t have a good score in the exams, but don’t even try to understand if they have some learning disabilities. This causes problems of self-esteem in students. Psychologists can detect these learning disabilities and can detect these problems and can collaborate with teachers to develop teaching strategies suitable for students with learning disabilities.”"
"“Many students struggle with various issues such as anxiety, self-esteem problems, friendship training problems, etc. Orientation and support are very important to help them overcome these problems. So, educational institutions should have mental health professionals to help students.”"
"“In 2020, an average of 34 students suicide each day due to various reasons, such as exam pressure, and relationship problems. Therefore, it is very important to provide their support in educational institutions. The Advisors can help them cope with pressure and can help improve their mental health. If the student suffers from mental health problems such as severe depression, consultants will take the measures to make them treated by psychiatrists.”"
"“The covid pandemic has affected many people’s mental health. Since schools and colleges have been closed for a long time, many students have felt isolated and this has caused an even more negative impact on mental health. As schools and colleges have reopened, students need help to adapt to the new normal.”"
"“Some students don’t even understand what they’re going through, maybe they don’t even know how to ask for help. Having a consultant at their educational institution will greatly help them understand their problems. They will also learn to ask for advice and help.”"
"“When university education is free, the number of graduates will increase dramatically. Currently, many people do not have access to higher education. So many students are not joining college because of the financial status of their parents. Free education will be very helpful for them.”"
"“At the moment, the rich are becoming richer and the poor are becoming poorer. A free university education will also reduce social inequality because, as everyone can study and learn skills at the college, everyone will have a equal opportunity to establish themselves in the career of their choice.”"
"""Some students are taking educational loans to study and then have to work hard to refund their loans. Many people are forced to hire jobs immediately after college to refund loans. But with free education, they will have freedom in career choices such as choosing a job or becoming entrepreneurs or experimenting with concerts, etc.”"
"“In many countries there is a lack of qualified workers. When university education is free, this problem will be solved.”"
"“At present, private investments in education have led to an improvement in the quality of education. Without the marketing of education, the quality of education cannot improve much.”"
"“Less disadvantages to public life, less road traffic and less losses to our economy. Since all government staff can be used at once, we can also increase supervision, and factors such as black money, stand capture, etc. It can be reduced.”"
"Having both elections together will also mean mixing national matters with state matters. National matters would exceed the state that, in turn, would have less priority from the politicians.”"
When state elections are held together with the center the regional parties can be marginalized because the same party obtaining the majority in the center can obtain the votes in the state as well.
"""Frequent elections in the country will often report politicians to the public, while reducing elections would mean making them pig for the rest of the mandate and suddenly becoming too active during the election year."""
"“Nearly 3 lakh people have been employed in the petard industry in these places, and 5 lakh people in packaging, transport, distribution, and the sale of these cracker. Therefore, the ban would also mean a huge unemployment in these countries.”"
"""Bursting crackers on Diwali has always been on the list of things to do in every family. A Deepavali without petards will be a cutting in entertainment and recreation for children as well as the elderly.”"
"“Banning petards in some places that currently have pollution at its peak like Delhi-NCR obviously down the poisonous emission of gas that has deadly effects on the entire balanced ecosystem. The highest level of particle recorded in Delhi was 2.5 in 2016, which actually made Delhi the world’s most polluted city in terms of air pollution. The Central Commission for the Fight Against Pollution [49] also stated that the level of sulphuric hydrogen in the air becomes tremendously high between 21.00 and midnight during Deepavali.”"
"“Regulated crackers on the market include chemical components such as salt, carbon and sulphur. When these are fully burned, hazardous gas oxides are emitted that cause drought, reduce visibility and other health risks. Medical experts say the air is contaminated with toxic gases and remains for days after Diwali. Toxic elements that reach the lungs cannot be removed later and can cause serious health problems. This will have long-term effects on children.”"
"“With the ban, religious feelings are also dismissed. In 2017, the Hindu community raised questions about the prohibition of Christmas trees on Christmas, or grabbing lamb on Eid, or colours on Holi, etc., thinking of being against their common practices.”"
India is the second most populated country in the world. It is already difficult for the Indian government to provide food security and basic needs to the entire Indian people. Adding additional charges will worsen the situation.
The accommodation of refugees would cause the resettling of some Indians. The Indian government tried to give refuge to the Rohingya by resettling some of them in the Jammu region. This may not be the right step and will cause anxiety to the resettled Indians.
"“The Rohingya have their own ethnicity and culture. By accepting them, we will only add more culture to India’s already widespread culture.”"
"“To let the Rohingya return to the place where they don’t get recognition means more loss of human lives, and in greater extent. The Rohingya population is 1.1 million, and if violence and torture continue on them, then there will be no one in the community anymore.”"
The acceptance of the Rohingya will surely give a good impression of our country’s hospitality to foreign lands. This will improve India’s opportunities to get permanent membership in the United Nations Security Council (CSNU).
"“Accepting refugees fleeing deaths is an act of humanity. The Rohingya people were brutally treated by the Myanmar government because of racism. Being a close country, we should accept those people who are in profound difficulties.”"
To allow refugees is a potential threat to the security of any country. Refugees can be a easy betrayal for terrorists. They can take advantage of the situation and carry out illegal activities using refugees.
"Consensual sex can also be called rape if the wife is willing to submit a false case. There will be no evidence to prove whether it is consensual or not. Punishing men on the basis of the simple words of the wives is completely wrong, due to the assumption that women don’t lie. Good and evil are not related to gender. There are also criminals.”"
"""The most abused law in the Indian judicial system is Section 498A, which allows women to submit a case on a husband and his family in case of donkey harassment. Many women are using this law to waste money and property from their spouses. If the law on marriage rape comes into force, many innocent men will be in danger.”"
"Sexual violence violates human rights, regardless of the relationship between the criminal and the victim. The IPC 375, which criminalizes rape, discriminates married women for using the section on their husbands. Although you can submit a case under domestic violence act for marriage rape, not calling marriage rape as a crime dissuading the victims to archive the cases. Every law on the planet tends to be abused. This means that we should not have laws to avoid false cases.”"
"“There will be no sense of security. We cannot sleep peacefully because the value of cryptocurrencies continues to fluctuate. Standard currencies also fluctuate, but are not as high as cryptocurrencies. If the value of the standard currency decreases, we can still allow us to live in our country, because the decline of the currency value affects all fields. For example, if the expenditure prices rise, our wages also do so. But if the value of cryptocurrencies like bitcoin falls, we’ll lose our hard earned money.”"
"The future belongs to technology. Cryptocurrencies make peer-to-peer financial transactions much easier. This coin can be sent from anywhere in the world. So there will be no currency exchange struggle such as Dollars for the Rupee etc. As you travel around the world, there will be no obstacle to exchange our currencies with local currencies.”"
"“Reality shows give children the opportunity to pull out their hidden talents and train their skills. It gives them a sense of purpose and direction from a very young age. The current educational system does not include other career options such as singing, reciting, dancing, games, etc. The reality shows that it closes this escape in the educational system.”"
"“Reality shows put enormous pressure on the participants to do well every time. Children cannot manage this stress, and this can cause mental health problems. Almost all reality shows involve the process of eliminating participants one by one at each level. Fighting the defeat in front of everyone is not so easy for children. This can put an emotional footprint on the children.”"
"“In these days, many songs and dances in the movies should not be seen by children. Singing and dancing to these oscene songs will exploit the innocence of children and create confusion in their minds."
"“Triple Talaq is a provision of the Islamic personal law that allows men to divorce from their wives by saying Talaq three times. Triple Talaq violates fundamental rights such as the right to equality, the right to non-discrimination and the right to live with dignity because this provision is available only for men and not for women. Women are subject to living in fear of being divorced unilaterally from their husbands. This violates their right to live with dignity.”"
"“The triple talaq should take place in three stages with time intervals. This allows time for reconciliation and arbitration. Since instant divorce is a triple talaq abuse, the prohibition of the provision itself is not the solution.”"
"“Triple Talaq does not follow the guidelines of the Qur’an of discussion, arbitration to resolve disputes, witnesses of divorce, the time period specified to reconcile, or even a real attempt to resolve differences.”"
“It’s part of their faith and personal laws can be contested. Article 25(i) of the Indian Constitution provides for freedom of religion.”

Why is it all seen in sexual nature? Brahmacharya does not mean that women cannot worship God. Brahmacharya means observing the celibate. This does not mean that there should not be women devote to the reproductive age. People with restricted mentality do not understand the difference between devotion and sexual attraction.
"""Some other temples also prohibit women, and some temples prohibit men. If it were the same with Sabarimala, people would not be worried. But treating menstruations as impure and prohibiting women of reproductive age is regressive and need to deal with. Menstruation is a biological process. Not allowing women to menstruate in temples sends a wrong message to people and to future generations.”"
The temple of Sabarimala is taking funds from the government and therefore the state government has the right to make changes to the law for the temple.

"“In general, they have consistent minds, are punctual and are dedicated to their work. These integrated qualities make you better than men.”"
Such competitions and beauty competitions have a very wrong influence on society as we all quickly follow the media trends. All this is fundamentally sending the wrong message to our young girls of generation in which they are made to understand that being perfect and gracious is extremely necessary. This affects their self-esteem and can also cause depression.
"“They encourage aesthetic surgery. Women these days, are ready to spend thousands of dollars to get hair extensions, false teeth, botox injections, body implants, spray brushes, brand clothes and makeup products. This could be extremely expensive to afford and such expenses are infinite. Cindy Jackson is a television star. She has a world record of 52 plastic interventions performed by her. Some women can also become dependent on such practices and then their not look back. This is the direct influence of society’s importance for beauty.”"
The beauty competition can increase the objectivity of women.

"“The U.S. treaties with Mexico will not allow them to build anything on the Rio Grande and the areas surrounding it. Moreover, most areas along the border in Texas are private property that leaves a large part of the border discovered. Building the wall will not bring any change.”"
"“There is a good possibility that the wall will never be invented. Projects like these take a great amount of time to complete and if in the next presidential elections, any other person is elected, there will be more likely than he/she to stop building the wall.”"
"According to the reports, illegal border crossing has actually decreased from 2014 to 2015, which does not make the building of the wall useful."

"Article 15 of the Indian Constitution prohibits gender-based discrimination. But the proposal for a law on marriage rape in petitions recognizes only female victims. Therefore, it is discriminatory for male victims."
"""Punishing men on the basis of simple words of wives is completely wrong, because of the assumption that women don't lie. Good and evil are not related to gender. There are also criminals.”"
"“The IPC 375, which criminalizes rape, discriminates married women by using the section on their husbands.”"
"“In these days, every man is considered a potential rape. If a woman makes a false claim of harassment against a man for revenge or any other reason, society is more likely to believe the woman’s words. Societies and media expose the accused before the investigation. This kind of attitude of society helps victims in real cases. But the scope of false cases is ignored. However, the same does not apply to complaints against women. If the complaint is against a woman, people doubt the authenticity of the case. What if the case of sexual harassment against that man was a false case? Some think men can take anything. Fake cases of harassment will cause irreversible loss of reputation and cause mental agony to the accused and his family.”"
"“Many false cases of domestic violence have been in India. The girl can drag her sisters to court, but the same is not true with a boy. In many cases of domestic violence, sisters are not even left with the couple, but are booked to ""influence"" the boy. The parents of the girl don’t “influence” her? And the most sad thing is that the girl can complain against her cousin and her cousin's husband even under domestic violence, even if they are not at her home. Women can be as cruel as men in harassing their partner.”"

"“It’s really a pity that many people have lost many of their rights during the night, a year ago. It is a shame that the United Kingdom has made such a decision. Brexit was the decision of generally uninformed or misinformed people who cannot be blamed for it. Especially those who have voted to stay or those who have not been able to vote at all. The truth is that the UK has always been a kind of ""black pear"" in the European Union.

"“It’s just an aneddotic proof, but I noticed in the high schools in my area that migrants’ children are more able to participate in post-school activities when their language is further developed. Children, of course, still go to school on a daily basis, which means they automatically take part in language lessons. However, seeing the positive results in language learning in these children, I can imagine that their parents could benefit in the same way if they were given the opportunity to follow language lessons (ideally at low budget/free).”"
Every immigrant in the European Union must have the opportunity to integrate even if the refugee status is unclear. Integration programs could support this development in all cases.

"“We have millions of real poor Europeans that we can help, why help the migrants who have nothing in common with us?”"
Most of the times migrants have difficulty entering society due to the language barrier and hatred. Providing their language lessons could reduce the tensions around migration and improve the integration of migrants.
"“The knowledge of the host country’s language is essential for integration. When migrants understand the local language, studies show that their values tend to those of host countries over time."

"“Working in sectors that have a wide need for workers, such as agricultural sectors, will contribute to the integration of immigrants once their situation is legalized.

"Genere is a concept of extreme left that has nothing to do with biology, physical universe, and reality."
"If we want to comply with our standards and what the European Union represents, we will help immigrants and give them the tools to help us improve our homes and our multiculturalism, so that, when the opportunity is presented, they can have a way to help their countries. Simply blocking them out of our region and neglecting them will not solve anything. We will only make useless enemies.”"
"“The world, especially Africa and the Middle East, is experiencing a huge demographic explosion. It seems that they are unable to do it as China did.  Who will take all these millions of refugees?  In addition, consider that the integration of a non-Western immigrant costs €167,000.  If the EU intends to survive, it must stop more or less all migration.”"
"“We must ensure a fair redistribution of refugees throughout Europe and a better integration of refugees and international protection seekers to work. A more concrete and fair European policy on economic migration, to create legal entrance channels and to promote an integration policy based on the respect of rights and equal treatment of local workers and migrants, as a key tool to address the social impact of migration flows.”"
"""The EU should attract the most talented and entrepreneurs in the world. The Junker Commission has been attempting to reform the Blue Card Directive in order to create a new simplified visa category across the EU, similar to the short-term Schengen visa. The owner of the new blue card, as seen, would have the entire EU labour market at their disposal.”"
For too long the EU has seen a net exodus or a brain escape of highly qualified people.
"""In comparison to most Anglo-Hong Kong countries, Europe has been quite shy in attracting talents around the world. Very few people are aware of this and take advantage of the Blue Charter of the EU. The EU is a choice destination for migrants and refugees from developing countries and some neighboring countries.”"
"“The future is the ‘work mobility’; therefore, we must simplify taxation, improve distance employment opportunities and allow to hire international staff.”"
"“Many migrants simply refuse to fight to change things in their countries. Once a migrant said to me, 'I want what you have, why should I sweat to build it in my country when he is here ready to be taken?' No, thank you.”"
"“If we need labor, we should look for the Europeans to come, not the Africans, the Arabs and the Muslims.”"
"“People born in Africa or poor countries are looking for a better place for their children to grow, where there is no war, and where there is food, good education and health systems.”"
"“Promoting, organizing and directing mass migration is a crime against humanity. At the moment, Lukashenko is committing this hateful crime. But it’s also George Soros and his NGOs who are engaged in the same hybrid war against Europe when they bring these migrants to our coasts.”"
The European Union will either be a fortress against illegal immigration or it will no longer exist in the future.
"“Europe is rich enough to welcome many immigrants and if they are allowed to work, they will also generate their own income and benefits for the country where they arrive.”"
"“They are justifying the genocide of indigenous Europeans who, at the question, always reject these ‘refugees.’”"
"As citizens of the European Union, we should never forget how privileged we are and that we have the human duty to help others in need. "
"It is necessary that the Member States better share their efforts to welcome asylum seekers when they arrive at the EU borders and do not leave this responsibility to the countries on the forefront.  The EU should develop a common approach to support the first-line countries to ensure that asylum seekers receive adequate care, assistance and protection upon arrival and are quickly distributed uniformly throughout the EU for the determination of their status.”"
The causes of leaving their countries of origin should not be neglected. The EU and its Member States need to intensify efforts to make their countries of origin more viable.
"“Successful migration is possible only when there is a vacant place in the host country, and the migrant has the required qualifications. Unlimited mass migration is the largest existing threat to the EU.  More than the CO2 threat.”"
"“A greater illegal and legal migration will lead to greater unemployment, lower wages, greater insecurity and less sustainable social systems.”"
"Respect for human rights and sharing efforts and solidarity should be of good sense in the EU Member States. Unfortunately, I am not yet.”"
"“I do not agree, every country must be sovereign to establish its own immigration policy and no EU quotas should be accepted.”"
"“Thro the EU, young people continue to face a number of significant challenges to enter and a stable position on the labour market. They do not easily get good quality jobs with decent wages and are still faced with a significant exclusion from regular employment, good quality education, training opportunities and adequate inclusion and coverage in national social protection systems. Young women and migrants are affected. We therefore need a fairer migration policy, but also to take into account the needs (and challenges) of migrants in other political sectors.”"
The shameful political (and practical) of Europe in these days towards migrants is contrary to the respect we have to show to the citizens of the world. And it is not in line with the fundamental rights that the European Union should put into practice. 
In the EU labour market we will need more workers outside Europe to continue the level of the economic activities we are planning. 
"It requires a balance between solidarity and responsibility. A reform of the Dublin system is needed, but the review work has not moved a centimeter since 2019. There have been attempts to make progress in the adoption of a common European asylum system and in the creation of a European resettlement system with sufficient financial incentives, while emphasizing its objective of closely monitoring migration routes and keeping the situation aware. The question should be strengthened at European level, as we never know when there will be a new crisis on our part, this time caused by climate change and environmental disasters that force people to go into diaspora and seek a safe shelter.”"
The EU should treat economic migrants more carefully. It cannot be the solution to the ageing of the European population. We need to focus more on border control to prevent illegal immigration. 
"“The human rights-based approach should be the fundamental principle. The legal channels for the entry and promotion of an integration policy based on the respect of the rights and the equal treatment of local workers and migrants, as they are necessary key tools to address the social impact of migration flows.”"
"“Migrant workers are overrepresented in the most precarious jobs, too often underpaid, work in unbearable working conditions and live in horrible housing structures. Workers are vulnerable to abuse and exploitation. And they continue to encounter unhuman working and living conditions because they lack an effective application. Trade unions are often not permitted on workshops with precarious jobs and migrant workers cannot therefore be adequately informed about their labour and trade unions rights. Third-country citizens are even more vulnerable than EU migrant/mobile workers.”"
"“Even though the number of TCN migrant workers increases tremendously, there is no adequate policy to protect their rights. Anyone in Europe should have the same rights as workers, no matter where they come from. Since migration is a question faced by all countries, we need to find a common answer at the EU level.”"
"The Dublin Agreement leaves the EU Member States with a completely single external border to address the immigration challenge. This must end! Not only because solidarity in the European Union is important for its cohesion, but also because the inevitable overload of the countries left alone by this challenge creates intolerable situations for refugees.”"
"“Before focusing on ensuring that immigrants have good conditions in the European Union, we should first focus on ensuring that our citizens can live respected lives in their countries. Countries where they paid taxes and supported with their work. So they are supported when they get sick, when they need help to take care of their children and when one day they go in retirement. The EU has not yet achieved this goal in all Member States. As such, such Member States should focus on restoring and improving the situation for their citizens first and once these countries are at high and have free resources left, then we can talk about improving the situation for immigrants.”"
"“Every country must have the right to choose on the basis of a democratic vote, how many immigrants want to accept.  The issue of immigrants depends on the reality and culture of each country: this must be managed at the local level.”"
"""We don't have to bring the problem to Europe, but we should rather help where it is needed in their region! """
"“Giving more rights to immigrants will lead to compulsory displacement and any cancellation of indigenous Europeans. It is a crime. If what is happening to the Uighurs and Tibetans in China is genocide, then it is that too. This proposed idea is not basic, it’s horrible minds to hide the fact that our immigration policies are completely anti-democratic and forced towards European natives.”"
"A fair, sustainable and open Europe is in the advantage of all.  Our common future requires actions to put human rights, solidarity and social justice at the top of the agenda.”"
The nations must have the last word about who they want to let live in their sovereign territories. 
"“Mass immigration is the biggest existing threat to the EU.  The UNCHR has already registered 70 million refugees, mainly from Africa and the ME. In Africa, 400 million people like to come to the EU.  Almost all people are without a useful education.  There is no other solution than a total stop to immigration.”"
"“I agree, but only at one condition: that every euro is spent under the joint control of local and European officials. There is so much corruption in Africa that otherwise for every 100 euros sent there, at least 80 would end in the pockets of corrupt officials. And in this case, it’s better not to send anything.”"
The European Union should be a paradise of solidarity and humanity. 
The migration pressure from Africa to Europe is due to a significant difference in the quality of life perceived. It is in the interest of the EU and its Member States to reduce this difference by working with the UA to level and develop African nations.
"“Yes, and it should be paid to all citizens of the European Union. People with a lower CO2 footprint – usually a lower-income family – would bring great benefits from it and would be encouraged to invest in cleaner energy, heating, etc.”"
"Esperanto should be promoted as an international frank language. Esperanto is an efficient and expressive means of intercultural communication, which enables a high degree of inclusion.”"
"""Give those who want to come a fair and secure chance to do it & send back those who really hurt your society. Give training, support, and opportunities. My assumption is that most will repay with their contributions.”"
We already have successful programs for refugee camps students. and engraving.
"“Yes, even though some countries have other problems at the moment. To give Member States the opportunity to choose: more refugees & more money & support or less refugees & less money & support. Very simple.”"
"""Take as an example the aircraft - how so, that is so common to be able to look for the tickets using one of the many web pages or applications, but in fact we can't do the same for the trains? The trains are more ecological.”"
"“If we have a European citizenship, we will have a country of the European Union and the European Union has already shown itself unable to deal with the problems and is extremely anti-democratic and does not listen to citizens.”"
"“There are countries like Greece to which, as I know, there is no railway connection from other European Union countries. This should be an absolute priority for the EU! """
This would help to plan the most efficient and cost-effective route. 
"“Yes, but the tax should be progressive per capita. This will make it possible to tax above all the excessive use of resources and to avoid increasing wealth inequality among the poor.”"
"“I agree. Only if we prove that criminals have no place in the European Union, we can convince our citizens that refugees are not a big threat. Making the control process that every refugee must pass through the public would also help to get rid of the feeling that anyone can simply come here and we need to close our borders.”"
Why should every EU country be sovereign in energy production? Even within the countries not all regions are sovereign in this sense. We must exploit the geographical potential of the European continent for pragmatic solutions.
"Not only to commit, but also to plan. Especially if an immigrant is bound to plan a terrorist act, he must be permanently removed from the EU.”"
Most experts agree that a carbon tax at EU level would be an effective way to limit our CO2 emissions. 
"“In my opinion, it will be essential to impose compensatory receipts on products from third countries to ensure that they do not have a competitive advantage.”"
"“In the end, the best solution would be a global agreement (as within the OECD and as planned) as the global minimum tax rate.”"
"“Absolutely right! If the eurocrats import what the people want, they’d ask him.”"
Cheap and affordable train trips approach everyone regardless of borders 
"“We need to think about more opportunities to enter the European Union legally. Many people come illegally, because we reject their opportunity to come, stay a little for work or education and return later. People die because of this foolishness.”"
"“I recently read that especially African families tend to send their smartest and better educated young people abroad to improve the family situation. These people are desperately needed both for the future of their countries of origin and for our future. We need qualified and educated people in many sectors, but it sends these people to their country of origin because they were unfortunate enough to be refugees.”"
"""It must work as with air trips: Book a coherent trip from A to B operated by various companies, and be sure that if something goes wrong, there will be a solution (re-re-re-repairing,...)."""
Nuclear energy is not green due to radioactive waste.
"“I agree, no one should emigrate to a country if he wants to commit a crime.”"
"“Nuclear energy is simply too expensive and therefore economically non-profit. According to researchers at RethinkX, in the next ten years, we will see a decay of clean energy that will stop investments in oil, coal and nuclear.”"
Africa and the Middle East have the highest birth rate in the world. Africa has up to seven children per woman. The EU has 1.55.  It is this high birth rate that keeps them poor. There is almost nothing that the European Union can do about this.”
The EU is not responsible for the whole world.
All refugee camps should be closed. And the clandestines returned to the last country they left. 
Helping migrants to learn the language and culture of the country in which they live is essential for successful integration. The language and the rules of the labour market and the workplace should also be integrated.
Africa is the only continent where the number of young people continues to increase. 
Discussing what has happened in the past between Africa and Europe is useless. All the slaves and their owners have died long ago. You can’t blame your grandchildren.
"“If there are language problems, we must work on national integration systems, for example. In France where English is thought in French. The language.”"
We already have English as a language of exchange.
"""English is the ideal because it is spoken internationally as the language of trade, travel and political exchange. The Esperanto is no.”"
Migration is part of the human being and has always occurred throughout history.    
"“The EU needs a human, civil and legal way to manage migration, both for economic reasons and to seek international protection.”"
The EU Member States must stand up together instead of trying to put the burden on each other or on foreign nations.
"“We need to accept a greater number of immigrants to fight European population aging. Immigrants also age, but before that they generally have children.”"
"“Paying taxes is not enough, if you want to become a citizen with all the rights you need to fully embrace the country in which you live.”"
"“If young Europeans live abroad, they will feel racism alone in the country they live in.”"
"“No anatra would like to live with aquiles or passers.  It is nature, not desire.”"
Migrants have a total lack of critical thinking.  
Migrants are risking their lives.
Migrants depend on the social systems of other countries.
Migrants are selling drugs.
The EU should recognize that raising the birth rate in Europe and supporting European families to have (more) children is the most suitable long-term solution.
"“To increase birth rate and support young families, Hungary should be an example. We don’t have to rely on migration for this.”"
The emphasis on negative stereotypes towards migrants comes mainly from people who don’t know the Africans or other migrants or refugees. 
"“Migrants have a huge amount to offer in energy, new ideas and cultures. Why is this emphasis on imaginary “deepings”?"
"“If asylum applications are submitted from abroad, the costs for EU taxpayers to manage asylum seekers are reduced.”"
"“If asylum applications are submitted from abroad, the humanitarian crisis in the Mediterranean is over.”"
"“If asylum applications are submitted from abroad, the safety risks of asylum seekers are significantly reduced.”"
"“Mass migration is a direct hybrid war against our stability. State actors, such as Morocco, Belarus and Turkey, have already taken advantage of mass migration.”"
"“Mass migration is a direct hybrid war against our stability. NGOs organize, finance and promote migration to benefit.”"
"“Migration has completely lost control. The EU refuses to see the entity. Hundreds of millions of people love to migrate. All people without the right language and adequate education. The enormous number of immigrants threatens the existence of EU societies through crime, poverty and lack of accommodation.”"
 Refugees can get a visa from an embassy in one of the 54 African countries. All other immigrants must be returned within a week of arrival.
"“There are member states in the European Union that do not want asylum seekers in their country. For example, Denmark sends back all the Syrians and other Arabs.”"
Fear of the unknown is a normal behavior. It has saved our race for centuries since humanity was a simple monkey among others. 
"“In addition, when fear is strengthened by facts such as the rise of violence in each country with a high number of immigrants, and women’s rape is not a problem of “perception,” but a simple reality.”"
Interruption of immigration from non-European or non-world countries into the EU.
"“Instead of trying to stop immigration, we must create a good integration plan and at the same time improve the living conditions in the countries of the second and third world. This includes the struggle for climate justice and the reduction of the inequal distribution of wealth among countries.”"
There are certain rules for integration: integration does not mean giving up European values and culture.
There must be some rules for integration: integration does not mean completely open borders.
I am pleased to see that the idea of treating all immigration from non-European or non-First World countries remains strong. This message must be communicated very clearly to Brussels. 
No more non-European immigration. Europeans say no.
European citizens are the future of Europe. 
"“The struggle to keep migrants out is very myopic and unhistoric. Keeping the migrants out, the migration pressure will not decrease. So what do you suggest for the next year, within 10 years? """
"“Migration has been a historic fact and successful societies have found a way to turn migration into force. In our case, in order to alleviate the current long-term challenge, we must alleviate the migration pressure by making it attractive that migrants stay and help develop their countries. A project so useful, a European Marshal Plan for Africa would be a good project to invest in. The long-term return on investment would be more than financial: a close continent friendly, good relationships, access to the African market and natural resources. This is not a short-term solution. There is no short-term solution. We have to play for a long time!”"
"Why can Arab countries not repair refugees from other Arab countries? The same habits, religion and have enough wealth.”"
The issue is the policy and policy of the public sector. Goals should not be pursued. No problem to be solved. It is the nature of the beast. Balance the opposing interests. 
A humanitarian association that helps a migrant illegally enter the EU should lose its government/EU funding.
"“We should stop immigration from non-European or non-world countries into the European Union. However, if we want to stop this immigration, we must stop the causes. In fact, it is the war, poverty and European, Chinese and American neocolonialism that makes the people of African and Middle East countries flee to Europe. So Europe must finally take responsibility and protect these countries from corruption, war and neocolonialism and help them start their economy.”"
Migration from countries with incompatible cultural values and ideologies should be limited or stopped in order to ensure social cohesion in Europe. Obsolete ideologies and regressive values should not have a place in Europe. 
"“Migrants who are already (legally) here should be taught Western values so that they and their families can integrate/assimile, as the ancient saying says, ‘When in Rome, do as the Romans do.’”"
"“What we are seeing now are the first waves of a human tsunami. In sub-Saharan Africa, the population will grow to 2.0 billion over the years.  This is more than citizens living in the European Union and the United States today.  At the same time, the population in the EU is decreasing. When we keep the border open, the European Union as a vital society will disappear.  There is not much future for young Europeans.”"
Entry to the EU without permission automatically excludes a person from the right of asylum. 
"We must put an end to all escape – for example, automatically rejecting asylum requests from anyone who enters illegally in Europe."
"“In conclusion, we should say, ‘Europeans go home. Go home, leave every part of the world where we do business, exploiting cheap labour, rare minerals, selling weapons, invading foreign countries and exporting democracy, etc.”"
"The demographic problems for the European Union, which are real, must be solved by encouraging childhood and a generous family policy, not through immigration. We must celebrate Motherhood and Motherhood. We must realize that the education of a child implies serious costs for today’s Europe.”"
"“Multiculturalism creates chaos wherever it exists. Sweden has become the capital of Western rape, and the number of bombs and shootings is to the stars even in that country. France borders with civil war, whole territories are no longer under the control of the state. Europe must stop migration and asylum indefinitely. We have to put our European peoples in the first place, as the whole world is doing while our civilization is committing suicide on the basis of values imposed by sanctuary narcissists.”"
"“There is nothing wrong in not wanting your continent to become chaos and put your people in the first place, every civilization in this world takes that idea as obvious. We have to negotiate remigration agreements with third countries to return their citizens and we have to use Frontex to reject all migrants arriving at our borders.”"
The EU leadership is unable to fulfill its fundamental tasks: protect its borders and protect its people. Thirty years after the introduction of Schengen. 
Immigration should not be part of humanitarian aid. Humanitarian aid should be delivered directly to Africa/Asia. The agreement with Turkey should eventually be abolished.
"“Europe must remain Europe and citizens should not be imposed a cultural and religious change that they don’t want and that is crazy. See what the Arab or North African countries have become, after 1400 years of Islamism.”"
A humanitarian association that helps a migrant illegally enter the EU should be required to provide financial support in decent conditions. 
"“A humanitarian association that helps a migrant illegally enter the EU should also be traced before the court because it has not brought the clandestines to the safer harbour. In 90% of cases, the nearest port is Africa."
We must stop all funding to NGOs and all migration organizations within the European Union. Then we can talk about how to help people already here and how to help real people in need.
We must agree that people who do not comply with our immigration law are detained in the return centers.
The country of origin should absolutely be the most important criterion to decide who we let enter our countries. 160 French people would still be alive if we put the well-being of our people above the people whose countries the Americans bombed with brands.
"“It’s now, to be honest about this! Europeans have the right to self-determination like any other country out there! This is our house and a house for all is a house for no one.”"
Our European continent is in debt and has no resources to take care of people who have never paid taxes and continue to ignore our laws! We are already poor enough in Europe and we have to take care of them!
"I do not share the idea of removing the right of people to asylum and the right to live in the European Union because they came illegally. Instead, I would propose to facilitate legal migration. In this way you won’t have to migrate illegally and risk your life while you do it."
"“The refugee division is a long-debated plan. But in the end, no group involved is in agreement with these plans. Some countries don’t like these people at all.”"
