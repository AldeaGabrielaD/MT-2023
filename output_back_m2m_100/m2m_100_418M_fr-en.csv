"“This movement has the potential to make more people embrace the traditional forms of Indian martial art such as Kathi Samu, Musti Yudha, etc, and the traditional forms of dance and also healthy Indian snacks. And as a subproduct, this can lead to job creation.”"
"“The motivation to maintain physical condition should start from childhood. But in India, many schools lack playing fields. The lack of playgrounds can drive children to adopt inactive lifestyle.”"
"“Fit India Movement may not reach people living below the poverty threshold. To maintain a healthy lifestyle, physical activity and nutrient foods are necessary.

"“Labeling organizations as terrorist organizations and individuals as terrorists are completely different. If a person is designated as a terrorist, he will face social exclusion and will be deprived of means of survival, even if he has proved the opposite. The consequences will be irreversible. For example, in 2016 alone, 67% of cases were solved by a refund, which means they are likely to be innocent.”"
"“If someone is reserved under the UAPA, the burden of proofing his innocence is on them. This amendment allows the government to capture its property. So how will they pay the legal fees to prove their innocence, if they are wrongly accused?”"
"“This will give more police powers to the central government. It is possible to misuse the possibility of designating individuals as terrorists. For example, recently, several civil activists are called urban Naxals. If someone opposes the government, he will be vulnerable to be qualified as a terrorist. Because this amendment has made it easier to qualify anyone as a terrorist.”"
"“The terrorism of wolves alone is increasingly threatened. Solitary wolves terrorists have no association with terrorist organizations, but they are committing terrorist attacks alone. This new UAPA amendment is likely to stop the terrorism of wolves alone."""
"“To prevent human rights violations, a four-step review is added. India has not begun to designate individuals as terrorists. The United States, the European Union and China also have this provision.”"
"So far, only organizations were designated as terrorist organizations, but not individuals. The gap is that individuals from the banned organizations form new organizations and conduct terrorist activities. This amendment to the law on the prevention of illegal activities allows the government to designate individuals as terrorists, which allows to prevent terrorist attacks.”"
It is necessary to act strongly against terrorism in the context of increasing threats by terrorists. It is therefore necessary to strengthen the UAPA.
"""Today, India has no well-developed infrastructure to ensure data security. On the other hand, developed countries already have efficient infrastructure. So, rushing to the location of data may not be a wise step. Because in the absence of effective infrastructure, data is subject to cyber attacks. And the risk is serious here because it is financial data. But as the laws are adopted, it is very difficult to develop efficient infrastructure at a faster pace.”"
"“Data storage in India leads to higher operating costs for payment system operators. Because in other countries, they have cheaper alternatives. And also for cross-border transactions, they need to store the data in two places, which increases the costs. These additional costs are likely to be impacted on consumers.”"
"“Data localization laws lead to the establishment of several data centers locally. This will create many jobs and greatly help the country’s economy. It will also stimulate innovation on the ground, which will lead to cheap solutions.”"
"“All investigating crimes will need access to payment data. If the data is stored abroad, it is very difficult to obtain permission from that country to access the data. This leads to delays in the resolution of crimes. If the data is stored here in our country, this problem will be avoided.”"
"""India is a big consumer market for many foreign companies. Thus, India and other developing countries realize the economic value of data and the importance of data location. With the location of the data, the national companies and the economy of the country will be beneficial. And we can also ensure data security.”"
"“Data is considered a ‘new form of wealth’. In general, companies use data to understand consumer requirements and also to influence their behavior. New products can be developed by analysing data to meet consumer needs. The data has an economic value. In general, developed countries benefit from this opportunity thanks to their well-developed infrastructure.”"
"“We are in a globalized world. Today, the world works on the free movement of people, goods, services and data. Data localization laws appear to be part of protectionist policies, which constitutes a threat to the free movement of data.”"
"“The United States is against data localization laws. Recently at the G20 summit, U.S. President Donald Trump spoke against data localization. Its position is natural because it increases the operating costs of U.S. companies. The bilateral relations between India and the United States are important for both countries because we are linked to the export and import of IT services, professional and goods, etc. So imposing data localization laws without threatening Indo-American relations is another challenge.”"
We can ensure the confidentiality of the data by locating the data.
The location of the data may result in the government’s surveillance of its citizens.
"“Data localization is important for data sovereignty, which means that citizens’ data should be held by the respective governments and not by other countries.”"
The law is very clear about the fact that RTI does not only deal with government bodies. It is also for non-governmental organizations that are substantially financed and controlled by the government. There are many subsidies (including tax exemptions) which are benefited by political parties and which are therefore substantially funded by the Government.
"“Political parties are independent bodies, they do not have to give accounts to the public. They were not established by the Constitution or by a law of the Parliament.”"
"The ITR Act stipulates that wherever there is public interest, these bodies must be transparent and cover the scope of the law. Today there are a number of private organizations, whether they are partially or entirely funded; schools, hospitals, etc. which are under the Law on Access to Information and not just government organizations.”"
The income tax law and the Electoral Commission contain appropriate provisions that allow people to have the information they want.
"“The ITR Act contains provisions pursuant to Article 8 that mention the notion of competitive interest. Certain exemptions are provided in cases where it can be proven that the disclosure of information can harm the competitive advantage of the party. This is not only a problem with political parties, but also a large number of governmental and private bodies.”"
"“Political funding is the source of corruption. Citizens have the right to know where political parties collect these funds, how they spend them and on the basis of their decisions. Crony’s capitalism will be substantially blocked if the political parties are subject to the RTI law.”"
"“According to the IT Act, political parties do not need to disclose donations that are less than 20,000 INR. An informal study conducted in 2010 on 6 key political parties shows that they raised Rs 700 crore. 95% of the amount was increased by amounts below Rs 20,000. It is very likely that political parties will use this gap to their advantage.”"
"“Political parties declare certain promises in their manifests. After being elected, citizens have the right to know why the promises made by political parties have not been fulfilled.”"
“Political parties are at the heart of democracy. Political parties form the government. Government policies are then governed by the party’s ideology. So it becomes essential that political parties are subject to the RTI.”
"“If political parties fall under the RTI, it will affect their internal proper functioning. Rivals can use RTI to malign themselves. Moreover, as political parties are not directly connected to the public, an RTI would be invalid.”"
"“In general, the Indians see educational institutions as employment machines, we expect to get unemployed and find a job. We do not realize that we will need to improve our skills to become employable. That’s why more than 80% of engineers are unemployed and the figures are even worse for non-engineers.”"
"“Al we have created national institutions over the past 40 years, we have not invested inining their standards. Funding is needed for quality education. Even the best Indian institutes lack infrastructure, laboratories, resources, etc. And even what is available is just to pass students to the exam and stay inactive the rest of the time.”"
"“Today, no problem has a single solution and no new technology is linked to a single discipline. We need multiple contributions from several disciplines and our institutions have failed to do so.”"
"""Indian students are brilliant when they travel to different countries in the field of research. This means we don’t lack talent, we lack infrastructure and a healthy environment for our living minds.”"
"“We have not paid our teachers as much as their counterparts earn in other countries. As a result, people are rejected to the idea of teaching as a career. We have not even managed to attract foreign faculty to our institutes.”"
"It takes time to excellence in anything. Through their degree, students acquire so much knowledge in the relevant field. Thus, it is easier for employers to train these students to industrial requirements.”"
Any skill can be learned and mastered even if we do not have a degree in this field. Programming is no exception.
"""Even if someone has a degree in IT, he has to learn so much to enter IT work, because there is a gap between industrial standards and the skills that are taught in engineering colleges. Furthermore, as technology is constantly evolving, even if someone has prepared for industrial standards in his graduation, he has to learn new technologies constantly to remain relevant on the labour market. So, as the learning curve will be there for IT students, non-IT students can also learn these things and can enter IT jobs.”"
"“The number of jobs in information technology is growing at a fast pace due to the technological revolution. There will be more jobs in the field of information technology. And if the recruitors are very strict on the degree, they may miss a large pool of talents, which are of a non-IT past.”"
"""Now we have so many online course platforms through which we can learn almost any expertise from experts. We can also get certificates if we succeed in testing. So, as Tim Cook said, a 4-year degree looks old and traditional.”"
"""In many engineering schools in India, we can easily pass the subjects even if they don't have a lot of knowledge in these subjects. This is why many companies are unable to find appropriate talents, even if there are so many eligible graduates. So the desire to become an expert in the field is more important than a degree.”"
"""If a non-IT student has chosen to start a career in the field of computer science, the efforts he has made to obtain his degree will be empty."""
"""Al new programming languages replace the old, the basic concepts are the same for almost all programming languages. So, whoever has a degree in coding will have an advantage over the student of a non-IT training.”"
"“People change their careers even after working in a field for several years because our interests change. So when someone can do so while having so many personal responsibilities, it’s much easier for young people to learn a new skill.”"
"“The variable salary increases the productivity of employees. People with high yield feel well paid and rewarded for their efforts, while people with insufficient yield also feel motivated to improve.”"
"“In variable pay schemes, employees feel satisfied and motivated by their work. They believe that they are an integral part of the organization, that they recognize them as part of its growth and that they value their efforts.”"
“The variable salary helps to retain valuable employees. This helps to retain good talents for long periods and consequently reduce the expenditure spent on the hiring of new talents. This ensures the stability of the organization.”
"“It has been found that it is difficult to keep employees in the release period when they are subject to variable wages schemes. Workers who receive commissions do well when the business is good, but they do bad when the business is bad. In the slowing period of business, even the best sellers might have difficulty making enough sales to earn a decent life. If the market is slow and the ordered workers cannot earn enough, they can look for other job opportunities. In a weak period, fixed wages can be more efficient to prevent employees from leaving for other occasions.”"
"Variable wages can lead to unhealthy competition among employees. They become less willing to help each other. Team cooperation can be affected negatively. In the long term, relationships between colleagues can become bitter. While, in fixed pay schemes, employees are able to maintain cordial relationships in the office.”"
"“Most times, sales jobs have a variable component. This could have a negative impact on the employee’s attitude towards customers. They can force customers irrationally just to make profits for themselves. They could overestimate the price for customers just to make more profit. While a fixed wage employee would maintain healthy and positive relationships with customers, which would allow him to find the right balance in his approach.”"
"“The enormous data we produce every day is analyzed and powered into our devices through algorithms that we end up giving more and more control of our lives to gadgets. We may feel that we receive all these services for free, but they come at the price of our precious time and our attention.”"
"With all the data and algorithms, our applications and gadgets, without our conscious knowledge, make decisions for us. Decision making is one of the qualities that have made people different from others.”"
"“After a quarter daily of 10 hours from Monday to Friday, most of us prefer to stay at home during the holidays. We are surrounded by laptops, TVs and mobile computers and we use them in cycles for Netflix, sports, social networks, etc. And rather than to go out. We prefer and are more comfortable with online conversation rather than talking to people for true. There are fewer significant relationships today due to all of the factors above. We began to prefer isolation.”"
"“Nuclear technology is a very effective alternative to non-renewable energy resources. But we have always chosen to go ahead with more and more types of nuclear weapons. The same goes for almost all other inventions. Likewise, although AI promised us better lives at first, because of AI, we began to lose our fundamental human qualities.”"
"“We have begun to lose our basic human habits and instincts, and we are actually governed by devices and applications.”"
"“As Yuval Noah Harari says, what we need now is morality and spirituality. Moral is to reduce suffering in the world. Spirituality is asking questions and seeking answers. Religions provide us with just answers and no field of questions.”"
"“Religion has served its goal of uniting people, establishing structures in society and developing confidence and cooperation. But in the 21st century, we are in full growth towards objective realities, and religion is an inter-subjective reality and now the only thing it does is to create differences in the world, to wash people’s brains, to develop animosity for other beliefs, and to provide rituals that are just shortenings to become a good person. (A Muslim can pray 5 times a day; a Hindu can pray every day for hours in temples; a Christian can go to the church every day, but still, be involved in immoral activities.)"
"“In the past, every unknown thing dealt with religious beliefs. But now science and technology have taken everything back. We know the causes of drought, earthquakes, windstorms, etc. These are scientific phenomena and not the anger of the gods.”"
"“Because of their technological nature, new banks do not need physical banking branches, which helps them to save on general costs (the operating cost of the company). Thus, new banks are able to offer customers lower fees and higher interest rates on control and savings accounts.”"
"“People don’t trust new banks so much because they don’t have a physical presence, making them a risk for customers in case of problems or challenges. Customer service personally may seem more trustworthy to customers.”"
Technological literature is still very low in India. Traditional banks can meet the banking requirements of less technologically warned customers or people from rural regions of the country who prefer face-to-face interaction with the manager.
"“Commercial banks contribute to the creation of credit, which leads to an increase in production, employment and consumer spending, which contributes to the growth of the economy.”"
"“As new banks are fully digital, they work 24 hours a day and their services are available at any time. They are easy to access from anywhere through a smartphone.”"
"“Fintech companies can open specialized new banks that target a specific type of customer. For example, LXME aims to become the first Indian Neo Bank for Women, which will offer product solutions that meet the specific financial needs of women and emotional preferences.”"
"“5G in the banking sector will bring the necessary financial inclusion to rural and remote populations of India, for whom access to a physical bank is not possible.”"
"“The low latency of 5G will allow the inclusion of education in the remote regions of India, where children will have access to high quality education at home without any network gap between them and their favorite tutor. In addition, 5G will allow us to use new technologies such as AR and VR for more immersive learning in schools and colleges.”"
"“5G will significantly increase the number of networks that can be connected, manipulating up to a trillion Internet terminals of objects, allowing machines and humans in a factory to communicate without collision, making the company more efficient and reducing the possibility of errors.”"
"“The government will be able to improve its governance and give a push to its digital India initiative, which aims to ensure that government services are made available to citizens by electronic means, which will allow the country to be equipped with digital means in the field of technology.”"
Hydrogen is inflammatory and can cause fires or explosions. So it is not completely sure yet.”
"“If hydrogen production uses fossil fuels, it can be counterproductive. It is therefore important to use renewable energy to produce hydrogen.”"
"Hydrogen pile vehicles do not issue greenhouse gases. This helps to fight climate change. Since many countries opt for the energy transition, clean hydrogen vehicles and other alternative fuel vehicles can open the way to sustainable transportation. Moreover, as these vehicles do not issue greenhouse gases like carbon dioxide, they can greatly reduce air pollution.”"
"“Fossil fuel prices continue to rise. So if more hydrogen vehicles enter the market, the price of fossil fuels could fall.”"
Hydrogen vehicles are much more silent than fossil fuels. So they can reduce sound pollution as well.”
"“If hydrogen escapes into the air, it can increase global warming.”"
"“Thro the pandemic, social media helped people maintain their social life.Social media allowed them to stay in contact with friends and loved ones all the time. We can easily know what is happening in their lives. It allowed us to communicate with several people at the same time by sharing messages.”"
"“Through social media, we now have the opportunity to connect with many people, even if they don’t live in our region. Before social media, we could interact with people from our town or places where we go.”"
"By following friends on social networks and not communicating with them in private, we can only know the things they display on their accounts. We may not know much about what’s really happening in their lives. This means that we will not have any significant ties with friends. The ease of contacting people online has made us prefer to meet them outside.”"
"“Some people now have social anxiety because they don’t have enough face-to-face interactions. When we avoid talking to people for a long time, we automatically develop a fear of taking part in small speeches.”"
Trolling on social media is a major threat. It affects the self-esteem of many people and also prevents them from creating social links.
"""In the book """"iGen"""""" it was mentioned that in the next decade, we could see more young people who know just the right emoji for a situation — but not the right facial expression. This can become true if we prefer virtual life to real life.”"
"“Through close communities or micro communities based on shared interests on social media as well as private messages, social media has given us the opportunity to establish real links with people with whom we can really get closer.”"
"""The NEET exam standardizes the entry criterion for medical education throughout the country. As a high score is necessary to enter the government's medical colleges, the exam ensures meritocracy."""
"But every year, less than 20% of students pass the exam. As a result, it is obvious that the quality of medical education in other countries where Indian students study is not at the level of medical education in India. It is therefore very important to take measures to provide affordable and high quality medical education in India.”"
"“As the exam requires additional study, the coaching centers take advantage of the situation and charge rupees for coaching for the NEET exam. So, due to this, students who cannot afford coaching are disadvantaged.”"
"“Students work hard to score well in class 12 exam, but all this hard work is not recognized. And only the NEET score is considered for entrance to the medical college, which is very unfair. In addition, the NEET exam is mainly based on the CBSE study program. So, the State Council students need to study additional things to get a good score at the exam.”"
"""A high score on the NEET exam is required to get admission to government medical colleges in India. It costs about Rs.1.25 crores to study in private medical colleges in India. Thus, many students are forced to go to other countries such as China, Ukraine, Russia, the Philippines, etc. Continuing medical studies. In these countries, medical education costs around Rs.35 lakhs. In addition, they allow students with low NEET scores, but above the thresholds.”"
Some people in the light of the moon to pursue their passion when the gains of their passion cannot replace the salary of their main work. Several entrepreneurs take this path and leave their job once they earn enough from their new.
"“According to a study published by the Academy of Management Journal in 2021, the lunar darkness can provide a sense of control and motivation, which can improve the productivity of employees.”"
"“The sudden dismissals of several companies, especially during the pandemic, have caused fear among many employees. And so several people took parallel concerts or a second job as a security network in case they were dismissed.”"
The light of the moon can help to increase losses in human lives. Some people want to acquire new skills beyond what they work on in their main job. This can help them develop their expertise in their fields. Some might get bored with monotonous jobs and thus take a second job to learn new skills and thus make their days exciting.
Companies are afraid of information and theft of sensitive data and the possibility of sharing it with their competing companies.
Some managers are afraid that lunar workers are not productive in their main work due to fatigue and increased stress. There are also concerns about working for other companies during the office hours of my main job.
"“In general, companies offer several benefits to employees, such as the forecast fund, health insurance, etc. Thus, they think it’s unfair when their employees focus their energy and time on a second job, which does not bring any of these benefits.”"
A money-free economy saves so much money for governments because printing and sending money to banks requires money and human resources. The need to buy or rent land for automatic ticket distributors will also be eliminated. International payments will also be easier because it is not necessary to exchange currencies.
Cash-free transactions leave digital footprints of financial transactions. They can be used to track illegal activities. 
COVID Pandemic has increased the number of transactions without species. They can prevent the spread of infectious diseases.
"“Transactions without cash are registered by the banks. Thus, the data will reveal the critical data of people about where they spend money. The government can easily access the data of anyone. This can result in mass monitoring programs. This is contrary to the right to privacy. Money gives us anonymity.”"
A money-free economy will increase the number of cybercrime.
Technical problems in the banking sector may stop access to our money. This can interfere with our daily lives.
"“The refugees are moved by force. They flee their country for several reasons such as violence, human rights violations, war, persecution of minorities, etc. They often face life threats in their country of origin. They leave their home and the rest in search of a safer place to live.”"
"“Today, many countries refuse refugees to declare that they constitute a threat to the economy or security. Only a few countries, including Lebanon, Jordan, Turkey and Liberia, accept the majority of refugees. Some host countries force refugees to their country of origin, declaring that the situation in their country of origin is safe. Many refugees who were sent like this have suffered brutal violence and some people have even disappeared.”"
All countries should share the responsibility of refugees. Refugees must be reinstalled immediately. They should be provided with improvement courses and employment opportunities to help them lead a decent life.
"“A weak global response worsenes the situation of refugees. The international community should help to reconstruct the countries broken by the war, from which refugees come, so that safe and decent returns are possible for refugees. Refugees should not be forcefully sent to their country of origin.”"
"“Many developed countries spend so much money to protect their borders, but don’t spend money to protect the lives of refugees. Additional funds are needed to protect refugees.”"
"“In general, some teachers punish students, who don’t get good results at the exam, but they don’t even try to understand if they have learning difficulties. This causes self-esteem problems among students. Psychologists can detect these learning disorders and detect these problems and collaborate with teachers to develop educational strategies suitable for students with learning disorders.”"
"“Many students struggle with several problems such as anxiety, self-esteem, difficulty forming friendship, etc. Orientation and support are very important to help them overcome these problems. Thus, educational institutions should have mental health professionals to help students.”"
"“In 2020, an average of 34 students committed suicide every day due to several reasons such as the pressure exercised by the exams and relationship problems. It is therefore very important to support them in educational institutions. Counselors can help them cope with pressure and improve their mental health. If the student suffers from mental health problems such as severe depression, the counselors will take measures so that they are treated by psychiatrists.”"
"“Covidian pandemic has affected many people’s mental health. Since schools and colleges were closed for a long time, many students felt isolated and this caused an even more negative impact on mental health. As schools and colleges have reopened, students need help to adapt to the new normal.”"
"""Some students don't even understand what they're going through, they may not even know how to ask for help. Having a counselor in their educational institution will greatly help them understand their problems. They will also learn to ask for advice and help.”"
"""When college education is free, the number of graduates will increase considerably. Currently, many people do not have access to higher education. So many students do not join colleges due to the financial situation of their parents. Free education will be very helpful.”"
"The rich are becoming rich and the poor are becoming poor. A free college education will also reduce social inequalities because, as everyone can study and learn skills at the university, everyone will have a equal chance to settle in the career of his choice.”"
"""Some students take study loans to study, and then they have to work hard to refund their loans. Many people are forced to take a job immediately after university to refund the loans. But with free education, they will have freedom in career choices such as the choice of a job or to become entrepreneurs or to experience with concerts, etc.”"
"“There is a shortage of qualified workers in many countries. When college education is free, this problem will be solved.”"
"“At present, private investments in education have helped improve the quality of education. Without the marketing of education, the quality of education may not improve much.”"
"“Less disturbances in public life, less road traffic and less losses for our economy. As all government staff can be used in a single time, we can also increase vigilance, and factors such as black money, capture stands, etc. It can be reduced.”"
"“The holding of these two elections will also mean a mixture of national and state matters. National matters would dominate the state which, in turn, would get less priority from the politicians.”"
"“When state elections are held with the center, regional parties can be marginalized because the same party obtaining the majority in the center can get votes in the state as well.”"
"“Frequent elections in the country will often bring politicians back to the public, while reducing elections would mean making them lazy for the rest of the mandate and suddenly becoming overactive during the election year.”"
"“Nearly 3 lakhs were employed in the petard industry in these places, and 5 lakhs in the packaging, transport, distribution, and sale of these craquelins. So the ban would also mean a huge unemployment in these states.”"
"""Bursting crackers on Diwali has always been on the list to do in each family. A Deepavali without petards will be a reduction in entertainment and leisure for children, as well as the elderly.”"
"“The ban on petards in some places where pollution reaches its peak, such as Delhi-NCR, will obviously reduce toxic gas emissions that have fatal effects on the entire balanced ecosystem. The highest particle level recorded in Delhi was 2.5 in 2016, making Delhi the world’s most polluted city in terms of air pollution. The Central Pollution Control Council also said that the sulphur dioxide level in the air becomes extremely high between 21 hours and midnight during Deepavali.”"
"“Regulated crackles on the market include chemical components such as spider, carbon and sulfur. When these are burned, hazardous gas oxides are released, which leads to asphyxia, reduces visibility and other health hazards. Medical experts claim that the air is contaminated with toxic gases and remains for days after Diwali. Toxic elements that reach the lungs cannot be removed later and can cause serious health problems. This will have a long-term impact on children.”"
"“With the ban, religious feelings are also triggered. In 2017, the Hindu community raised questions about the prohibition of Christmas-to-Christmas trees, the slaughter of the lamb at the Eid, colors at Holi, etc., thinking it was against their municipal practices.”"
India is the second most populated country in the world. It is already difficult for the Indian government to provide food safety and first-need products to the entire Indian people. The increase in this burden will make the situation worse.
The reception of refugees will lead to the re-installation of some Indians. The Indian government has tried to provide refuge to the Rohingya by reinstalling some in the Jammu region. This may not be the right step and it will cause trouble to the re-installed Indians.
"“The Rohingya have their own ethnicity and culture. By accepting them, we will simply add more culture to the already escaping culture of India.”"
"“Let the Rohingya return to a place where they don’t get recognition means more human lives, and to a greater extent. The Rohingya population is 1.1 million, and if violence and torture continue on them, then there will be no one in the community anymore.”"
The acceptance of the Rohingya will give a good impression of the hospitality of our country to foreign land. This will improve India’s chances of getting a permanent membership in the UN Security Council.
"“Accepting refugees who escape death situations is an act of humanity. The Rohingya were brutally treated by the government because of racism. As a neighboring country, we should accept people who are in profound trouble.”"
To allow refugees is a potential threat to the security of any country. Refugees can be a easy hostage for terrorists. They can take advantage of the situation and carry out illegal activities by calling on refugees.
"Consensual sex can also be qualified as rape if the woman is willing to file a false case. There will be no evidence to prove whether it is consensual or not. Punishing men on the basis of simple words of women is completely false, because of the assumption that women don’t lie. Good and bad are not related to sex. There are also criminals.”"
"The law that is the worst used in the Indian judicial system is Article 498A, which allows women to file complaints against a husband and his family in case of harassment to the dot. Many women use this law to extorc money and property to their grandparents. If the law on marital rape comes into force, many innocent men will be threatened.”"
"Sexual violence violates human rights, regardless of the relationship between the criminal and the victim. IPC 375, which criminalizes rape, establishes discrimination against married women for using the section on their husband. Although it is possible to file a complaint for marital rape under the Family Violence Act, the failure to qualify marital rape as a crime will dissuade the victims to file a complaint. All the laws on the planet are likely to be misused. This does not mean that we should not have laws to avoid false cases.”"
"“There will be no sense of security. We cannot sleep peacefully because the cryptocurrency value continues to fluctuate. Standard currencies also fluctuate, but not as high as cryptocurrencies. If the value of the standard currency decreases, we can still allow ourselves to live in our country, because the decrease in monetary value affects all fields. For example, if the food store prices increase, our wages also. But if the value of cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin falls, we will lose our hard earned money.”"
"“The future belongs to technology. Cryptocurrencies greatly facilitate financial transactions between peers. This currency can be sent from any part of the world to any part of the world. Therefore, there will be no currency exchange struggle such as Dollars for Ruby etc. When traveling around the world, there will be no obstacle to exchanging our currencies with local currencies.”"
"Reality shows give children the opportunity to show out their hidden talents and to train their skills. It gives them a sense of goal and direction from a very young age. The current educational system does not include other career options such as singing, theatre, dancing, games, etc. The reality shows that it fills this gap in the educational system.”"
"“Reality shows make huge pressure on the participants to behave well every time. Children can’t tolerate this stress, which can cause mental health problems. Almost all manifestations of reality involve the process of eliminating participants one by one at each level. Facing the defeat in front of everyone is not so easy for children. This can have an emotional impact on children.”"
"“Today, many songs and dances in films are not supposed to be seen by children. Singing and dancing to these obscene songs will exploit the innocence of children and create confusion in their minds.”"
"“Triple Talaq is a provision of Islamic personal law that allows men to divorce from their wife by saying three times Talaq. Triple Talaq violates fundamental rights such as the right to equality, the right to non-discrimination and the right to live in dignity because this provision is only available for men and not for women. Women live in fear of being divorced unilaterally by their husband. This violates their right to live in dignity.”"
"“The triple talaq should take place in three stages with time intervals. This leaves time for reconciliation and arbitration. As instant divorce is a misuse of the triple talaq, the prohibition of the provision itself is not the solution.”"
"“Triple Talaq does not follow the Quranic guidelines of discussion, arbitration to resolve disputes, witnesses to divorce, the specified period to reconcile, or even a real attempt to resolve disputes.”"
It is part of their faith and personal laws cannot be contested. Article 25(i) of the Constitution of India provides for freedom of religion.
"“If the value of the standard currency decreases, we can still allow ourselves to live in our country, because the decrease in monetary value affects all fields. For example, if the food store prices increase, our wages also. But if the value of cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin falls, we’ll lose our hard earned money.”"
"“Ransomware pirates have demanded their payment by Bitcoins, because it protects the identity of the person in financial transactions.”"
"“Many different religions and cultures coexist peacefully in India, which is quite surprising for the rest of the world. India is the best example of religious coexistence. If there is intolerance, it would not be possible.”"
“The incidence of crowd lynching has increased these days in the name of the informal ban of beef. And what’s sad is that the guilty remains impunity.”
Why is it all seen in a sexual nature? Brahmacharya does not mean that women cannot worship God. Brahmacharya means observing the celibate. This does not mean that there should be no female devotees in the reproductive age. Through mind people don’t understand the difference between devotion and sexual attraction.
"“Other temples also prohibit women, and some temples prohibit men. If it were the same situation with Sabarimala, people would not be worried about it. But treating menstruations as impure and prohibiting women in the childbirth age is regressive and must attack. Menstruation is a biological process. Not allowing women to menstruate in temples sends a bad message to people and to future generations.”"
The temple of Sabarimala receives government funds and therefore the state government has the right to make changes to the law for the temple.
"“If someone accuses any celebrity, the news will announce news for days on the news channels. This is a violation of human rights. The press channels ignore the fundamental thing that the allegations are not yet proven.”"
"“Reporters often try to tell the victims of the incident. Even in cases of death, journalists rush to the incident and ask questions to the victim’s family, when she really needs space and time to complain.”"
"“They are the managers of good time. As most women manage work and home today, they can prioritize their time.”"
"“In general, they have consistent minds, are punctual and are dedicated to their work. These integrated qualities make them better managers than men.”"
Such competitions and beauty competitions have a very bad influence on society as we all quickly follow the media trends. All this is fundamentally sending the wrong message to our young girls of generation where they are made to understand that being perfect and beautiful is extremely necessary. This affects their self-esteem and can even cause depression.
"They promote cosmetic surgeries. Today’s women are ready to spend thousands of dollars on hair extensions, false teeth, botox injections, body implants, sprayed bronzages, brand clothes and makeup products. This could be extremely expensive to pay and such expenses never end. Cindy Jackson is a television star. She has a world record of 52 plastic surgeries. Some women may even be bound to such practices and then don’t look back. This is the direct influence of the importance of society for beauty.”"
The beauty competition can increase the objectivity of women.
"“Most driverless cars will be electric vehicles (EVs) that will help reduce the level of pollution in the country, which is also one of the major problems the country is facing.”"
"“Even if driverless cars reduce vehicle accidents caused by human error, there are cases of driverless cars causing accidents.”"
"""If driverless cars are allowed in India, they can be used for various other purposes, such as delivery or collection service, which will also save time and human resources."""
"“The U.S. treaties with Mexico will not allow them to build anything on Rio Grande and the areas around it. Moreover, most areas along the border in Texas are private, leaving a large part of the border discovered. So building the wall will not bring any change.”"
"“There is a pretty good chance that the wall will never invent. Projects like these take a lot of time to complete and if in the next presidential elections any other person is elected, there will be greater chances that he/she will stop building the wall.”"
"According to the reports, illegal border crossing has actually decreased between 2014 and 2015, which is not useful for the construction of the wall."
"“India has always been friendly to the refugees. Therefore, the same spirit should beined in the case of the Rohingya community.”"
"“Accepting refugees who escape death situations is an act of humanity. The Rohingya were brutally treated by the government because of racism. As a neighboring country, we should accept people who are in profound trouble.”"
"Article 15 of the Indian Constitution prohibits gender-based discrimination. But the proposed law on marital rape in the petitions recognizes only women victims. Therefore, it is discriminatory to the victims of male sex."
"“Puncing men on the basis of simple wives’ words is completely false, because of the assumption that women don’t lie. Good and bad are not related to sex. There are also criminals.”"
"“The IPC 375, which criminalizes rape, discriminates married women from using the section on their husband.”"
"""Today, every man is considered a potential rapist. If a woman makes a false complaint of aggression against a man for revenge or for any other reason, society is more likely to believe the words of the woman. The police and the media have revealed the accused before the investigation. This kind of attitude of society helps victims in real cases. The scope of false cases is ignored. The same goes for complaints against women. If the complaint is against a woman, people doubt the ingenuity of the case. What if the case of sexual harassment against man was a false case? Some think men can take anything. False cases of aggression will lead to irreversible loss of reputation and will cause mental agony to the accused and his family.”"
"“Many cases of false family violence are in India. The girl can pull her grandparents to the court, but the same thing is not true with a boy. In many cases of family violence, grandparents have not even stayed with the couple, but are reserved to “influence” the boy. Does the child’s parents influence it? And the most sad thing is that the girl can complain against her sister and her sister also under family violence, even if they don’t stay at home. Women can be as cruel as men by harassing their life partner.”"
"“WikiLeaks has won a number of awards, including The Economist’s New Media Award in 2008 and the UK Media Award by Amnesty International in 2009.”"

"“Alcohol addiction is not only a threat to the person who drinks, but also to the whole family.”"
Crimes and accidents will be reduced to a certain extent.
"""Many types of jobs are increasingly replaced by technology. According to the reports, there is a significant decrease in the number of dactylographers, fabricers, construction workers, etc.”"
"“If a company is strongly dependent on human work, it tends to fail because it can’t face the competition of technologically advanced competitors.”"
"“India has a huge trade deficit with China. For the year 2017-2018, India’s imports from China are worth $76.2 billion, while India’s exports to China are worth $33 billion. It is therefore necessary to reduce this trade deficit.”"
"“Imports from China harm companies of Indian manufacturers, especially those of the small and medium-sized enterprises (PMEMs). China is able to produce products at cheaper prices due to its mass production methods.”"
"“China blocks India’s attempt to list Masood Azhar as a terrorist. Not only this, China prevents India from becoming a member of the Nuclear Suppliers Group (GSN) using its veto right. On the one hand, China wants to maintain good trade relations with India and on the other hand, it acts against India in many cases. Maintaining good trade relations with China may not be a good thing.”"
"“Trump has given priority to some notable issues such as the repression of Muslim immigration, challenging the independence of the Fed cabinet elections, bizarre and badly qualified, antagonizing China and other trade partners without reason or kissing Russia and its voyu regime. This is not acceptable beyond the limits and can transform people and communities against it.”"
Racism and white supremacy increased at the end of Trump.

Stray dogs are often carrier of diseases due to lack of care.
There are other ways than killing animals. Sterilization and elimination instead of killing them can solve the problem.
"“We don’t have the right to suffer from animals, even if there are benefits for us.”"
Tests can be performed on human volunteers with their consent. But animals are forced to pass tests without having a choice.
"“The criminal will feel the victim’s pain if he is subject to the same type of harassment. So, he cannot commit the crime again in his life."""
"“We live in a civilized society. The world prefers human ways of treating everyone, including criminals. We should not fall to the level of the criminal by tortureing him in an inhuman way.”"
"“In India, many cases of false rape are recorded these days. Torture of all accused people also causes torture to innocent people.”"
Reality shows give children the opportunity to show out their hidden talents and to change their skills.
"Reality shows act as a launchpad for children in the film industry. Some of the current singers, choreographers are integrated into films through reality shows for children.”"
Almost all reality shows involve the process of eliminating participants one by one at each level. Facing the defeat in front of everyone is not so easy for children. This can have emotional impact on children.
"“Through censorship, monetary power will govern society. It is a fact that the rich influence politics.”"
"“The filmmakers spend a lot of money and time making films. If parts of the film are cut down in the name of censorship, they will be discouraged to make more films.”"
Censorship leads to the imposition of majority ideals on others.
Reduction of the complexity of the RTI filling:
Failure of biometric authentication.
Many people are kidnapped for organs. Illegal trafficking of human organs is happening in almost every country. Some people sell their organs. All of these are the consequences of organ deficiency.
Not all organ transplants are successful. The body of the recipient can reject the organ of the donor.
"“Many people need organ replacement surgeries to survive. There is a shortage of organ donors. Therefore, mandatory organ donation after death can guarantee that no one will die due to the lack of available healthy organs.”"
Industry is also one of the worst successes. Investors can lose interest investing in the manufacturing sector as a banner by anyone that leads to loss for them.
"Although the right to demonstrate is a fundamental right, people do not have the right to withdraw the fundamental rights of others such as access to their work, the performance of their personal work, etc. Not everyone is against government changes. Some people may support it and do not support the ban. Forcing them to stay at home is antidemocratic.”"
"“Most of the bandits are translated into violence. Some political parties and organizations intentionally cause violence by burning public goods, destroying vehicles and hurting the population.”"
"""The standards of Indian cinemas sometimes fall because of Nepotism. Producers and directors push children stars to start in their films, not judging their acting talents and their presence on the screen. This leads to flop films and a loss of quality and standards in Indian cinemas.”"
The children of the stars also have an education that is surrounded by the Bollywood industry. This gives them the advantage of adapting and having a clearer insight into the industry. This could help them learn faster and do better what a stranger might not be able to do.
"“Bollywood cinema stars often launch their children with great ease into the industry. Such acts are the source of the debate on Nepotism. This kind of act has existed for centuries. Therefore, Nepotism obviously exists in Bollywood.”"
"“It would be smarter and cheaper to develop and encourage a limited speed, a low consumption of shared thermal cars, and to give up the myth of possessing a car.”"
"“Most of electricity is produced by thermal power plants that burn oil derivatives and by the nuclear industry.  So, until electricity production is not mainly by renewable energy, it is fundamentally out of mind what kind of cars we use.”"
"“Corn biogas plants need more energy to work than they supply. If the efficiency of a free surface VP plant is ten times higher on these arable lands, the biogas power plant should not be supported.”"
"“Climate change can only be successfully addressed globally, especially in emerging countries that will be responsible for most greenhouse gas emissions in a few decades. But to convince them to become green, we must acknowledge that we refuse them to build their economy as we have done in the past 200 years. We must therefore support emerging countries in their transition to a green economy.”"
"“If all costs, including CO2 emissions from production, resource extraction and their consequences for the region (environment and humans), damage to ecosystems, waste recycling, etc., were monetized and internalized in the costs of products, many of our problems would be solved. It would only make more environmentally friendly products cheaper than others and make their production more economically intelligent.”"
"“In a capitalist system in which all the environmental, social and health costs of all concerned persons would be internalized in the price of a product, the market could solve most of the problems.”"
This would strengthen the carbon wells throughout Europe.
This would help solve current habitat problems and species loss.
"“Gas power plants produce CO2. The methane that damages the climate is released during extraction and transportation, nuclear power plants produce radioactive waste - an inheritance for future generations - not to mention the current danger of rejection, for example. by attacks, geological events or operational accidents due to human or technical errors."
"“If we continue to invest in climate and in extremely expensive, regressive and environmentally harmful nuclear power plants or technologies, it’s a joke of the world and a loss of money and time that we can use for sustainable investments and transformations.”"
It is essential that environmental concerns and sustainability be the foundation of any treaty with our European Union!
It is in no way out of speech what type of cars people use; 25% renewable + 25% nuclear + 50% fuel is better than 100% fuel.

"“Being against solar energy, in my opinion, is simply irrational.  Insects also sometimes die by windmills, but much more often by hunger, birds or herbicides, insecticides, etc."
This is the idea we have made for 30 years. It has not produced enough results to justify the continuation of this path. It means that this problem will be solved by itself. This proposal is harmful and is not based on any data that could justify it.   
"“It’s not about blaming others. It is about seeing the situation as it is. Recognize the patterns, reasons and consequences of our behavior. We do not make our choices in the emptiness. If it’s easier and cheaper not to live sustainably, people will do it, even if they’re aware of it.”"
"“We should organize our cities, our economies and our policies so that it is easy for people to behave responsibly and ecologically. It requires a lot of work now, but it’s the job we have to do if we want to move to something more sustainable.”"
Sustainable and animal-friendly farms cultivate their own food and create an ecological cycle.
"“The current subsidies with a modular incentive system should be replaced, as they allow farmers to choose environmentally, socially, financially responsible and sustainable solutions that are already available – such as natural sequence agriculture, regenerative agriculture, permaculture, etc.”"
"In Germany, 60% of the land is used to feed animals. To determine the amount of subsidy that an exploitation receives, the surface of the exploitation is determinant. In other words, a lot of land, a great subsidy. This results in a cheap feed and, in the end, an intense breeding. Thus, if the State subsidizes feed and livestock on the basis of their size and not on the basis of the sustainability and well-being of animals, the concept of intense livestock will be supported.”"
Not just the batteries. The EU should have a comprehensive policy with a clear goal of limiting and reducing the planned obsolescence. 
"""To have to replace a whole cell phone (or tablet, camera, cell phone, etc.) Because a battery has reached the end of its useful life is unpleasant. It’s not only a pressure on consumer portfolios, it’s also devastating for the environment, as the energy and resources entering the manufacturing of electronics are artificially increased thanks to the short life of these devices.”"
CBAM is a central element of a comprehensive approach to zero net emissions by 2050 and to mitigate global warming.
"“If we want a stable and reliable energy network, we need a source of nuclear energy. Solar and wind energy are not reliable, they need a lot of batteries, and cannot be a single solution for the energy network.”"
Taxation seems to be the only real way to encourage other countries less concerned with climate change to work on it.
We should limit the displacement of factories to third countries where environmental legislation is more flexible. We need a single legislation to avoid this.
"Since the UN Sustainability Goals include working conditions, human rights, environmental and climate issues and governance issues, they are ideal for promoting sustainability in all sectors and avoiding non-sustainable practices and competition."
"“We must protect our planet, and without bees, worms or other arthropods, we are going to our own extinction!”"
"“Without bees, which die in mass, Europe is impossible to exist. The problem is complex and it’s about the influence of toxic pesticides and other agricultural and industrial chemicals, as well as the influence of GSM technologies, which lead to overheating the bee’s body, which falls under the negative impact of microwave. Europe must therefore create a series of policies to help bees survive in the name of the European nations’ surplus.”"
"“It is important to consider immigrants as people with a culture, a religious perspective and a very different but respectable idea of sociality compared to Europe. That is why we need to act in a coordinated and cautious manner between institutions and organizations.”"
"""Such a center could also play a bridge between local needs and opportunities at EU level, such as project financing."""
"“The center could also organize demonstrations to raise the local population awareness of issues related to migration, to stimulate the processes of social inclusion and to fight against the spread of fake news and migrant ostracism.”"
So the British voted to leave the EU and all the British have the same obligations as immigrants from non-EU countries.
"“The British people have voted for Brexit, so now they naturally have to live with their choice.  It turns out that you can’t have your cake and eat it too.”"
"“I think it’s a good idea, but unfortunately it’s conceived as a British/Brexit problem. However, the broader concept of a common EU visa/migration system is convincing. The harmonisation of the system with a common visa scheme has many advantages.”"
"“The British are not better than anyone else and do not deserve a special treatment from the EU. The British people will face the consequences of their decision to leave the EU and it is not the EU’s responsibility to make Brexit painless. The benefits of accession cannot be granted to citizens of countries outside the EU/EEA, such as the United Kingdom.”"
"“It’s really a shame that many people have lost a lot of their rights from day to day, a year ago. It is a shame that the United Kingdom has even made such a decision. Brexit was the decision of generally poorly informed or poorly informed people who cannot be blamed for it. Especially those who have voted to stay or those who have not voted at all. The truth is that the UK has always been a kind of ""brebis black"" in the EU. Even historically, the UK was often somewhat “deparated” from European politics and matters.”"
"“Cohesion Funds have become a mechanism that allows local oligarchs and political elites to maintain their power and influence in national contexts, which has made it possible to use EU funds for their own personal or political profits and to retain the profits of the people of cities and regions.”"
An increased percentage of funds devoted to cities and regions that are controlled and distributed directly by the EU institutions to local governments can first and foremost circumvent national systems that allow political dependence.
"This will add to transparency and fair competition.  Employers who are not honest should not have any advantage and, in substance, it would be beneficial for all EU members, and not just for workers.”"
"“The protection of the rights of those who effectively produce the services and products that constitute the European market is just an obvious thing. With an increasingly integrated EU, ignoring these rights will create fragmentation and conflicts.”"
The recent crisis at the Polish border only emphasizes the urgency of this proposal.
Europe can no longer afford to neglect to defend its external borders and to promote policies that promote illegal immigration and feed human trafficking. Strong and effective borders are the prior condition for any aspect of a common migration policy.
This should help address the causes of the lack of prospects and the escape of these countries in order to increase the youth’s desire to stay in their homes.
Frontex interferes with the national border guards who fulfill their sacred duty to protect the border and then sends anonymous reports to criticize these brave men and women is quite hateful. 
"“I’m working on a programme in Ireland to help migrants, refugees and asylum seekers find a job and integrate.  The qualifications, skills, experience and resilience they bring are amazing and so valuable for employers and the country.  The emphasis is too much on the negative aspects of migration, which rely largely on wrong stereotypes.  Migration brings a lot of positive to the countries, but we must be open to them.”"
"“We don’t have enough jobs and money for everyone in Europe! Stop the immigration. However, Turkey, Qatar, Oman, Egypt, the United States and Saudi Arabia have it! These countries can therefore welcome migrants instead of funding hundreds of mosques in Europe!”"
Why do immigrants who don’t speak the language of the country they want to reside? Migration is bad for nations and deteriorating for migrants. We must work to end mass migration. 
"“Indian Europeans have no obligation to welcome more migrants, and they don’t want it either. It is forced on us.”"
"“It’s just an anecdotal proof, but I’ve noticed in my region’s high schools that migrants’ children are more able to participate in post-school activities when their language is further developed. Of course, children still go to school every day, which means they automatically take part in language courses. However, given the positive results of language learning in these children, I imagine that their parents would enjoy the same way if they had the opportunity to attend language courses (ideally with low budget/free).”"
"“Every immigrant from the European Union must have the opportunity to integrate, even if the refugee status is not clear. Integration programs could support this evolution in any case.”"
"“No, Europe is not a colony. Immigration has been devastating. It is necessary to appoint EU officials that support immigration and to give European citizens a democratic opportunity to withdraw them from their power and influence positions.”"
"“We have millions of real poor Europeans that we can help, why help the migrants who have nothing in common with us?”"
"“Most times, migrants have difficulty integrating into society due to language barriers and hatred. Giving them language lessons could reduce the tensions around migration and improve migrants’ integration.”"
"Knowledge of the language of the host country is essential for integration. When migrants understand the local language, studies show that their values tend to those of host countries over time.”"
"It is essential that European principles and values be taught to migrants, including an explanation of the reasoning that is based on these principles and values. It would be better that this is provided both in the mother tongue of the person and in the language of the host country.”"
"“For more than 50 years, immigration is uncontrolled and uncontrolled. No change should be made before we have an agreement on the fact that people who ignore our immigration laws should be held in repatriation centers without any chance of reintegrating the EU. Once we will agree on the fact that we will be able to start talking about funds and resources for those who deserve help.”"
"“Working in sectors that have a great need for workers, such as agricultural fields, will contribute to the integration of immigrants once their situation is legalized. And most importantly, education is necessary, an intensive education to integrate both in language (of course) and in culture: history, philosophy, literature, etc."""
"“Europe needs a greater number of women to have children and raise them in a good way, which helps to transmit our culture: our culture is a praise to the world and must be saved from the invasion and destruction of globalization.”"
"“Massive migration is a evil that hurt both nations and migrants themselves, who suffer from indignity and risk their lives. We must stop mass migration. This requires that migrants be helped as close as possible to the origin of migration.”"
EU bureaucrates who have allowed immigration must be appointed and a democratic process to withdraw them from power must be established.  Democracy must prevail over this multicultural fascism.
"“I think the EU bureaucrates and politicians should give the example to the rest, especially to Merkle. They should also give them 30% of their salary.”"
"“NGO ships should be banned, only Frontex should intervene to bring them home.”"
"“A total prohibition of Muslim countries is ridiculous, the direction of these countries and the media representations of the population of these countries do not reflect the people who live there, they are not a threat to us.”"
"“Gender is a concept of extreme left that has nothing to do with biology, physical universe, and reality.”"
"“If we want to respect our standards and what the EU represents, we will help these immigrants and give them the tools to help us improve our homes and make them multicultural, so that once they have the chance to present themselves, they will be able to help their countries. The simple fact of blocking them from our region and neglecting them will not solve anything. We will only make unnecessary enemies.”"
"“The world, especially Africa and the Middle East, is experiencing an enormous demographic explosion. They don’t seem to be able to deal with it as China did.  Who will take all these millions of refugees that result?  Also consider that the integration of a non-Western immigrant costs €167,000.  If the EU intends to survive, it must stop more or less all migrations.”"
"“We must ensure a fair redistribution of refugees throughout Europe and a better integration of refugees and seekers of international protection at work. A more concrete and equitable European policy on economic migration, the establishment of legal entrance routes and the promotion of an integration policy based on the respect of the rights and equal treatment of local workers and migrant workers, as an essential tool for dealing with the social impact of migration flows.”"
"""The EU should attract the most talented and entrepreneurial people in the world. There was an attempt to reform the Blue Cards Directive by the Junker Commission to create a new EU-wide simplified visa category, similar to the short-term Schengen visa. The holder of the new blue card visa would have the entire EU labour market.”"
"""The EU has seen, for too long, a net exode or a flight from the brain of highly qualified people."""
"“In comparison to most English-speaking countries, Europe has been shy enough to attract talents around the world. Too few people know and use the Blue Card of the EU. The EU is a choice destination for migrations and refugees from developing countries and some neighboring countries.”"
"“The future is the ‘work mobility’; so we have to simplify taxation, improve the possibilities of distance work and allow the recruitment of abroad.”"
"“Many migrants simply refuse to fight to change things in their own country. Once a migrant said to me, “I want what you have, why should I sweat to build it in my country when it is ready to be taken here? “No thanks.”"
"“If we need workforce, we should look for the future Europeans, not the Africans, the Arabs and the Muslims.”"
"“People born in Africa or poor countries are looking for a better place for their children to grow up, where there is no war and where there is food, good education and health systems.”"
"“Promoting, organizing and guiding mass migration is a crime against humanity. Lukaschenko is currently committing this hateful crime. But George Soros and his NGOs are also engaged in the same hybrid war against Europe when they bring these migrants to our coasts.”"
"“Of the EU will be a fortress against illegal immigration, or it will no longer exist in the future.”"
"""Europe is more than rich to accommodate many immigrants and if they are allowed to work, they will even generate their own income and benefits for the country in which they arrive."""
"“You justify the genocide of indigenous Europeans who, when asked, still reject these ‘refugees’.”"
"“As EU citizens, we should never forget how privileged we are and that we have the human obligation to help other people in need.”"
"It is necessary that Member States better share their efforts to welcome asylum seekers when they arrive at the EU borders and do not leave that responsibility to the first-line countries.  The EU should develop a common approach to support the first-line countries to ensure that asylum seekers receive the necessary care, assistance and protection at their arrival and that they are quickly distributed uniformly throughout the EU for the purpose of determining their status.”"
The deep causes of leaving their country of origin should not be neglected. The EU and its Member States need to double efforts to make the countries of origin more viable.
Successful migration is possible only when there is a vacant position in the host country and the immigrant has the required qualifications. Unlimited mass migration is the biggest existential threat to the EU.  More than the threat of CO2.
"“A more illegal and legal migration will lead to an increase in unemployment, a lower wages, greater insecurity and less sustainable social systems.”"
"Respect for human rights and sharing efforts, as well as solidarity, should be of good sense in the EU Member States. Unfortunately, they are not yet.”"
"“I do not agree, each country must be sovereign to establish its immigration policy and no EU quota should be accepted.”"
"“In the EU, young people are still facing a number of major challenges to enter the labour market and a stable position. They do not easily obtain good quality jobs with decent wages and are always faced with significant exclusion from regular employment, good quality education, training opportunities, and adequate integration and coverage in national social protection systems. Young women and migrants are affected. So we need a more equitable migration policy, but also to take into account the needs (and challenges) of migrants in other political areas.”"
The shameful (and practical) policy of Europe towards migrants today is contradictory with the respect we have to manifest to our citizens around the world. And it is not in accordance with the fundamental rights that the EU is supposed to implement. 
"“On the EU labour market, we’ll need a greater number of workers from outside Europe to continue the level of economic activity we’re planning.”"
"We need a balance between solidarity and responsibility. A reform of the Dublin system is needed, but the revision work has not progressed by an inch since 2019. An attempt has been made to advance in the adoption of a common European asylum regime and the establishment of a EU-wide resettlement system with sufficient financial incentives, while emphasizing its objective of closely monitoring the migration routes andining awareness of the situation. This question should be strengthened at European level, because we never know when there will be a new crisis in our hands, this time caused by climate change and environmental disasters forcing people to go into the diaspora and seek a safe refuge.”"
The EU should treat economic migrants more carefully. They cannot be the solution to the ageing population in Europe. We need to focus more on border control to prevent illegal migration. 
"“The human rights-based approach should be the fundamental principle. The legal ways of entering and promoting an integration policy based on the respect of the rights and equal treatment of local workers and migratory workers, as essential tools to cope with the social impact of migratory flows are necessary.”"
"“Migrant workers are overrepresented in the most precarious jobs, they are too often underpaid, they work in intolerable working conditions and live in horrible housing. Workers are vulnerable to abuse and exploitation. And they continue to face unhuman working and living conditions because there is no effective application. Trade unions are often not allowed to work on precarious workshops and migrant workers cannot therefore be sufficiently informed of their trade unions and trade unions rights. Third-country nationals are even more vulnerable than EU migrant/mobilist workers.”"
"“Al there is a significant increase in the number of migrant workers from the CNT, there is no adequate policy to protect their rights. Everyone in Europe should have the same rights as workers, no matter where they come from. Since the issue of migration is addressed by all countries, we need to find a common answer at EU level.”"
"“The Dublin Agreement leaves the EU Member States an entirely unique external border to address the immigration challenge. It must stop! Not only because solidarity within the EU is important for its cohesion, but also because the inevitable overload of the states left alone with this challenge creates intolerable situations for refugees.”"
"“Before focusing on ensuring that immigrants have good conditions in the EU, we should first ensure that our own citizens can live in respect of life in their own country. Countries where they paid taxes and supported with their own work. To be supported when they fall sick, when they need help to take care of their children and when they retire one day. The EU has not yet achieved this goal in all Member States. As such, these Member States should focus on repairing and improving the situation for their own people first and once these countries are at the level of standards and they have free resources, then we can talk about improving the situation of immigrants.”"
"“Every country must have the right to choose on the basis of a democratic vote, the number of immigrants it wants to accept.  The issue of immigrants depends on the reality and culture of each country: it must be managed at the local level.”"
"“We should not bring the problem to Europe, but rather we should help where it is necessary in their region!”"
"“Giving more rights to immigrants will lead to forced displacements and the elimination of indigenous Europeans. It is criminal. If what happens to the Uighur and Tibetans in China is a genocide, then that’s the case. This idea proposal is not at the foundation, it’s distorted lies to hide the fact that our immigration policies are completely anti-democratic and forced for indigenous Europeans.”"
"A fair, sustainable and open Europe benefits everyone.  Our common future requires actions aimed at placing human rights, solidarity and social justice in the top of priorities.”"
The nations must have the last word about who they want to allow to live on their sovereign territories. 
"“Massive immigration is the biggest existential threat to the EU.  The UNHCR already has 70 million registered refugees, mainly from Africa and the ME. In Africa, 400 million people like to come to the EU.  Almost not all people have useful education.  There is no other solution than a almost complete cessation of immigration.”"
"“I agree, but on a single condition: that each euro is spent under the joint control of local and European agents. There is so much corruption in Africa that otherwise of 100 euros sent there, at least 80 would end in the pockets of corrupt officers. And in this case, it is better not to send anything.”"
The European Union must be a hole of unity and humanity. 
The migration pressure from Africa to Europe is the result of a significant difference in perception of quality of life. It is in the interest of the EU and its Member States to reduce this difference by collaborating with the UA on the leveling and development of African nations.
"“Yes, and it should be paid to all EU citizens. People with a lower CO2 footprint – generally low-income families – would get a great profit from it and would be encouraged to invest in cleaner energy, heating, etc.”"
"“Esperanto should be promoted as an international lingua franca. Esperanto is an effective and expressive means of intercultural communication, allowing a high degree of inclusion.”"
"“Give those who want to come a fair and secure opportunity to do so and send back those who really hurt your company. Giving training, support and opportunities. I think most will pay back with their contributions.”"
We already have successful programs for refugee camps students. Improve it.
"“Yes, although some countries have other problems at the moment. To give Member States the opportunity to choose: more refugees & more money & support or less refugees & less money & support. Very simple.”"
"""Let's take the aircraft as an example - how, it's so common to be able to search for tickets using one of the many web pages or applications, but we can't do the same for trains? The trains are more ecological.”"
"""If we have a European citizenship, we will have a EU country and the EU has already shown itself unable to deal with the problems and is extremely anti-democratic and does not listen to the population."""
"“There are countries like Greece to which, to my knowledge, there is no railway connection with other EU countries. This should be an absolute priority for the EU! """
This would help to plan the most efficient and economical route 
"“Yes, but the tax should be progressive per resident. This will enable us to impose excessive use of resources and to avoid the growing inequality of the wealth of the poor.”"
to hear. Only if we show that criminals do not have their place in the EU we will be able to convince our citizens that refugees are not a threat. Making the verification process that every refugee must pass through the public would also help to get rid of the feeling that anyone can come here and that we must close our borders.
Why should every EU country be sovereign in energy production? Not all countries are sovereign in this sense. We must take advantage of the geographical potential of the European continent for pragmatic solutions.”
"Not only to commit, but also to plan. In particular, if an immigrant is taken for a terrorist act, he must be permanently expelled from the EU.”"
Most experts agree that an EU-wide carbon tax would be an effective way to reduce our CO2 emissions. 
"“In my opinion, it will be essential to impose compensatory charges on products from third countries to ensure that they will not have a competitive advantage.”"
"“Finally, the best solution would be a global agreement (as within the OECD and as planned) such as the global minimum tax rate.”"
"“This is quite true! If the eurocrates were concerned about what people want, they would ask them.”"
"“Accessible and accessible railways bring everyone closer, no matter the borders.”"
"“We should consider other possibilities of entering the EU legally. Many people come illegally, because we refuse them the opportunities to come, stay a little for work or education and return later. People die because of these absurdities.”"
"“I recently read that African families in particular tend to send their most intelligent and best-educated young people abroad to improve the family situation. These people are desperately needed both for the future of their country of origin and for our future. We need qualified and trained people in many sectors, but we return these people to their country of origin because they were unhappy enough to be refugees.”"
"""It must work as with air transport: Book a coherent journey from A to B operated by different companies, and make sure that if something goes wrong, there will be a solution (reservation,...)."""
Nuclear energy is not green due to radioactive waste.
"“I agree, no one should migrate to a country if they will commit a crime.”"
"“Nuclear energy is simply too expensive and therefore economically unsustainable. According to researchers at RethinkX, we will see a clean energy disruption over the next ten years, which will leave investments in oil, coal and nuclear fail.”"
Africa and the Middle East have the highest birth rate in the world. Africa has up to 7 children per woman. The number is 1.55.  This is the high birth rate that keeps them poor. The EU can do almost nothing.”
The EU is not responsible for the whole world.
All refugee camps should be closed. And the clandestines returned to the last country they left. 
Helping migrants to learn the language and culture of the country in which they live is essential to the success of integration. The language and standards of the labour market and the workplace should also be integrated.
Africa is the only continent where the number of young people continues to grow. 
It is unnecessary to discuss what has happened in the past between Africa and Europe. All slaves and their owners have died a long time ago. You can’t blame the grandchildren.
"“If there are language problems, we need to work on national integration systems, for example. In France where English is thought in French. The language.”"
We already have English as a language of exchange.
"""English is ideal because it is spoken internationally as a language of trade, travel and political exchange. The esperanto is not.”"
Migration is part of the human being and has always occurred throughout history.    
"“The EU needs a human, civilized and legal way to manage migration, whether for economic reasons or to obtain international protection.”"
EU Member States must stand up together instead of trying to impose charges on others or on foreign countries.
"“We need to accept more immigrants to fight the ageing population in Europe. Immigrants are also aging, but before, they usually have children.”"
“Paying taxes is not enough if you want to become a citizen with all the rights you need to fully embrace the country in which you live.”
"“If young Europeans live abroad, they will feel racism themselves in the country where they live.”"
"No cattle would like to live with eagles or monkeys.  It is nature, not the desire to think.”"
Migrants have a total lack of critical thinking.  
Migrants are happy to risk their lives.
Migrants are dependent on the social systems of other countries.
Migrants are selling drugs.
The EU should recognize that increasing birth rates in Europe and supporting European families to have (more) children are the most suitable long-term solution.
"“To increase birth rates and support young families, Hungary should be an example of this. We should not rely on migration for that."""
The emphasis on negative stereotypes towards migrants comes mainly from people who don’t know the Africans or other migrants or refugees. 
"“Migrants have a huge amount of energy, new ideas and cultures. Why is this emphasis on imaginary “controls”?"
"“If asylum applications are filed abroad, the costs of handling asylum seekers for EU taxpayers are reduced.”"
"“If asylum applications are filed from abroad, the Mediterranean humanitarian crisis ends.”"
"“If asylum applications are submitted from abroad, the security risks of asylum seekers are significantly reduced.”"
"“Massive migration is a hybrid war against our stability. State actors such as Morocco, Belarus and Turkey have already benefited from mass migration.”"
"“Massive migration is a hybrid war against our stability. NGOs organize, finance and encourage migration to benefit.”"
"“Migration has become completely uncontrollable. The EU refuses to see its scope. Many people like to migrate. All people without the right language and appropriate education. The massive number of immigrants threatens the existence of EU societies due to crime, poverty and housing shortage.”"
 Refugees can get a visa from an embassy in one of the 54 African countries. All other immigrants must be returned within a week from their arrival.
"“There are members of the European Union who do not want asylum seekers in their country. For example, Denmark returns all the Syrians and other Arabs.”"
Fear of the unknown is a normal behavior. He saved our race since ages when mankind was a simple monkey among others. 
"“In addition, when fear is strengthened by facts such as the increase in violence in all countries where the number of immigrants is high and the rape of women, it’s not a problem of ‘perception’ but a simple reality.”"
Stop all immigration from non-European or non-European countries from the first world to the EU.
"“Instead of trying to stop immigration, we need to create a good integration plan while improving living conditions in the 2nd and 3rd countries of the world. This includes the struggle for climate justice and the reduction of the inequal distribution of wealth between countries.”"
It requires rules for integration: integration does not mean abandoning European values and culture.
There must be rules for integration: integration does not mean fully open borders.
I am pleased to see that the idea of fighting any immigration from non-European or non-European countries is still strong. This message must be very clearly communicated to Brussels. 
More non-European immigration. Native Europeans said NO.
European citizens are the future of Europe. 
"“It’s enough to fight to keep migrants away is very myopic and not historic. Keeping the migrants away, the migration pressure will not be mitigated. What do you offer for the next year, in 10 years?"
"“Migration has been a historic fact and prosperous societies have found ways to turn migration into force. In our case, in order to alleviate the current long-term challenge, we must mitigate the migration pressure by making it attractive for migrants to stay and to help develop their own country. A project so useful, a European Marshal Plan for Africa would be a good project to invest. The long-term return of investment would be more than financial: a friendly neighboring continent, good relationships, access to the African market and natural resources. This is not a short-term solution. There is no short-term solution. We have to play the long game!”"
"“Why can Arab countries not welcome refugees from other Arab countries? The same habits, the same religion and they have enough wealth.”"
This is the issue of policy and policy development of the public sector. No objective should be pursued. No problem to be solved. This is the nature of the beast. Balancing conflicting interests. 
A humanitarian association that helps a migrant illegally enter the EU should lose its government/EU funding.
"“We must stop any immigration from non-European or non-European countries from the first world to the EU. However, if we want to stop this immigration, we have to stop the causes. In fact, it is the war, poverty and European, Chinese and American neocolonialism that make the peoples of countries of Africa and the Middle East flee to Europe. So Europe must finally take responsibilities and protect these countries from corruption, war and neocolonialism and help them start their economy.”"
Migration from countries with incompatible cultural values and ideologies should be limited or ceased to ensure social cohesion in Europe. Regressive ideologies and exaggerated values should not have their place in Europe. 
"“Migrants who are already (legally) here should be taught the Western values so that they and their families can integrate/assimile, as the old saying says “when in Rome, do like the Romans.”"
"“What we see now are the first waves of a human tsunami. In sub-Saharan Africa, the population has grown over the years to reach 2.0 billion inhabitants.  This is more than the people who live today in the EU and the United States.  At the same time, the population in the EU is decreasing. When we keep the border open, the EU, as a viable society, will disappear.  There is not much future for young people.”"
Access to the EU without a permit automatically excludes a person from any asylum right. 
"“We have to end all the faults – for example, automatically reject asylum requests from anyone who enters illegally in Europe.”"
"“In conclusion, we should say, ‘Europeans go home. Go home, leave all the regions of the world where we do business, exploit cheap work, rare minerals, sell weapons, invade foreign countries and export democracy, etc."
"""The EU's demographic problems, which are real, must be solved by encouraging reproduction and generous family policy, and not by migration. We must celebrate maternity and mothers. We must realize that the education of a child leads to serious costs in today’s Europe.”"
"“Multiculturalism creates chaos everywhere it exists. Sweden, Stockholm, has become the capital of the Western rape, and the number of bombs and shootings has also exploded in this country. France is at the edge of civil war, whole territories are no longer under the control of the state. Europe must stop migration and asylum indefinitely. We must give priority to our European peoples, as the whole world does when our civilization commits suicide on the basis of the values imposed by sacred narcissists.”"
"""There's nothing wrong not to want your continent to become chaos and put your people first, every civilization in this world takes this idea as obvious. We have to negotiate reimmigration agreements with the third countries to return their nationals and we have to use Frontex to reject migrants arriving at our borders.”"
EU leaders do not fulfill their fundamental tasks: to keep their borders and to protect their own citizens. Thirty years after the introduction of Schengen. 
Immigration should not be part of humanitarian aid. Humanitarian aid should be provided directly to Africa/Asia. The agreement with Turkey should be abolished.
"“Europe must remain Europe and citizens should not be imposed a cultural and religious change that they do not want and which is foolish. See what Arab or North African countries have become, after 1400 years of Islam.”"
A humanitarian association that helps a migrant illegally enter the EU should be required to provide financial support in decent conditions. 
"""A humanitarian association that helps a migrant illegally enter the EU should also be trapped before the court for not taking the illegals to the nearest harbour. In 90% of cases, the nearest port is in Africa."
"“We must stop all financing to NGOs and all migration organizations within the EU. So, can we talk about how to help people already here and how to help real people in need.”"
We must agree that people who do not comply with our immigration law are held in repatriation centers.
The country of origin should absolutely be the most important criterion to decide who we let enter our countries. 160 French people would still be alive if we put our well-being above the peoples whose Americans bombed the countries.
 It is time to be honest about this! Europeans have the right to self-determination as any other country! A house for everyone is a house for no one.
Our European continent is debtful and has no resources to take care of people who have never paid taxes and who continue to neglect our laws! We already have enough poor in Europe and we have to take care of it!
"“I do not agree with the fact that people are deprived of their right of asylum and their right to live in the EU because they have come illegally. I would rather suggest facilitating legal migration. In this way, there would be no need to migrate illegally and risk your life while doing so.”"
"“The refugee division is a long-debated plan. But at the end, no group involved is in agreement with these plans. Some countries don’t like these people at all.”"
