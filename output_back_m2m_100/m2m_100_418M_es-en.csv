"Due to the inactive lifestyle and stressful life, many people are receiving lifestyle diseases such as diabetes, hypertension, etc. The Fit India Movement can encourage people to consume healthy foods and maintain physical and mental fitness.”"
"“With high-quality ads and marketing practices, chat food manufacturers are manipulating children to buy their food. This Fit India Movement will make children think about the negative consequences of chattery food. As a result, this movement will encourage children to consume healthy foods.”"
"“Some parents put too much stress on children to study. They send their children to classes after school or simply make them sit down to do their duties forgetting the importance of free time to play. This movement has the potential to change opinions and as a result, they can encourage their children to go out to play.”"
"“This movement has the potential to make more people embrace traditional forms of Indian martial art such as Kathi Samu, Musti Yudha, etc, and traditional forms of dance and also healthy Indian snacks. And as a subproduct, this can result in the creation of some jobs.”"
"“Motivation to maintain aptitude should start from childhood. But in India, many schools lack recreational courts. The lack of recreational courts can push children to resort to inactive lifestyle.”"
"“The ‘Movement of India’ may not reach people who are below the poverty line. To maintain a healthy lifestyle, both physical activity and nutritional foods are necessary. But in India, many people are still unhealthy and some people have no access to drinking water. Therefore, without solving the problem of poverty and the lack of access to affordable nutritional food, a sector of the Indian population will not be able to take advantage of this movement.”"
"""Some people are already focusing on physical aptitude. We can observe this with the growing number of fitness startups. But that is a small proportion of people. Usually, many people want to maintain an active lifestyle, but all they need is a bit of stimulation. Therefore, this movement constantly reminds people to focus on fitness goals as Swachh Bharat reminds us of the importance of keeping our environment clean.”"
"“Since the invention of machines, the value of workers is decreasing. They are made to work to support machines. As a result, work turns around machines and not humans. Workers are compelled to work continuously alongside the machine.”"

"“Industrialization increased working hours. Workers are faced with unhuman conditions. Humans cannot work and focus continuously as machines. So far, we have technological devices to check how many hours we really work. Some companies want to be connected 24 hours a day through emails and messages. This makes people feel less human.”"
"“Our decision-making skills are also being affected as we are now asking search engines to know what’s the best. We depend on the Internet knowledge base even in the offices to finish the work by hand. This affects cognitive skills (thinking, reading, learning, remembering and reasoning), which is an essential quality of human beings."
"“Many face-to-face communications are also replaced by virtual interactions. Many people now live in virtual households, which is the smartphone. As the need to speak with each other is decreasing, the ability to communicate with each other, which is a basic quality of the living beings, is decreasing.”"
"“Every time we depend more on the technology devices that guide us. For example, we keep reminders on smartphones and google questions to get answers. We are subcontracting activities that require intelligence to technology. Thinking, remembering things and analyzing are essential qualities of human beings. Too much dependence on technology is making us less humans.”"

"“This bill gives exclusive competences to the National Research Agency (NIA). NIA can take any person under its custody under the UAPA without prior permission from the state government. This is against federalism, which is guaranteed by the Constitution of India.”"
"“The labelling organizations as terrorist organizations and individuals as terrorists are very different. If a person receives the name of terrorist, he will face social exclusion and will lack opportunities to earn life even if he has shown the opposite. The consequences will be irreversible. For example, only in 2016 67% of cases ended in absolute, meaning they are probably innocent.”"
"“If someone is registered under the UAPA, the burden of proofing their innocence lies in them. This new amendment is allowing the government to confiscate its property. So how will they pay the legal expenses to prove their innocence, if they are false accused?”"
"“This will provide more police powers to the central government. The designation of people as terrorists can be used unfairly. For example, recently several civil activists are called Naxals Urban. If someone opposes the government, he will be vulnerable to be incriminated as a terrorist. Because this amendment made it easier to label someone as a terrorist.”"
"“There is a growing threat of solitary wolf terrorism. Solitary wolf terrorists do not have any associations with terrorist organizations, but they commit terrorist attacks alone. This new amendment to the UAPA has the potential to stop solitary wolf terrorism.”"
"“To prevent human rights violations, a four-step examination is added. India does not initiate the designation of people as terrorists. The United States, the European Union and China also have this disposition.”"
"So far, organizations were only designated as terrorist organizations, but not as individuals. The lagoon in this is that individuals from the prohibited organizations are forming new organizations and carrying out terrorist activities. This amendment to the Prevention of Illegal Activities Act allows the Government to designate people as terrorists, so terrorist attacks can be prevented.”"
"“It is necessary to act firmly against terrorism in the midst of the growing threats of terrorists. Therefore, it is necessary to strengthen the UAPA.”"
"“Today, India does not have a well-developed infrastructure to ensure data security. Moreover, developed countries already have efficient infrastructure. Therefore, rushing to the location of data may not be a wise step. Because without an efficient infrastructure, data is prone to cyber attacks. And the risk is serious here because it is financial data. But as the laws are made, it is a great challenge to develop efficient infrastructure at a faster pace.”"
"“Data storage in India means higher operating costs for payment system operators. In other countries there are cheap alternatives. And also for cross-border transactions, they have to store the data in two places, which increases the costs. There is the probability that these additional costs may impact consumers.”"
"Data localization laws lead to the creation of multiple data centers at the local level. This will create a lot of jobs and will enormously help the country’s economy. It will also drive innovation on the ground, which will lead to low-cost solutions.”"
"“When investigating the crimes, it will be necessary to access the payment data. If the data is stored abroad, it is very difficult to obtain permission from that country to access the data. This causes delays in the resolution of crimes. If the data is stored here within our country, this problem will be avoided.”"
"“India is a great consumer market for many foreign companies. Therefore, India and other developing countries are realizing the economic value of data and the importance of the location of data. With the location of data, the national companies and the country’s economy will benefit. And we can also guarantee the security of data.”"
"“Data is considered a ‘new form of wealth’. In general, companies use data to understand consumer requirements and also to influence their behavior. New products can be developed by analysing data to meet consumer needs. The data has an economic value. In general, developed countries are taking advantage of this opportunity with their well-developed infrastructure.”"
"“We are in a globalized world. Today, the world is working with the free flow of people, goods, services and data. Data location laws seem to be part of protectionist policies, which constitute a threat to the free flow of data.”"
"The U.S. It is contrary to the data location laws. Recently at the G20 summit, U.S. President Donald Trump spoke against the location of data. Its posture is natural because it increases the operating costs of U.S. companies. bilateral relations between India and the United States. They are important for both countries because we are interconnected in the export and import of IT services, professionals and goods, etc. Therefore, imposing data location laws without threatening Indo-American relations is another challenge.”"
We can guarantee the privacy of the data by placing the data.
The location of data can lead to government surveillance of its citizens.
"“Data location is important for data sovereignty, meaning that citizens’ data should be owned by their respective governments and not by other countries.”"
"“The law is very clear in the sense that RTI does not only deal with government bodies. It also corresponds to non-governmental organizations that are substantially financed and controlled by the Government. There are numerous subsidies (including tax exemptions) of which political parties enjoy, so they are substantially funded by the Government.”"
"“Political parties are independent organs, they don’t have to give accounts to the public. They were not established by the Constitution or by a law of the Parliament.”"
"“The IRR Act states that, wherever there is public interest, those organizations must be transparent and subject to the scope of law. There are a number of private organizations today, whether partially funded or entirely; schools, hospitals, etc. They are under the Anti-Terrorism Act and not just government organizations.”"
There are appropriate provisions in the Income Tax Act and with the Electoral Commission so that people can have the information they want.
"""Article 8 of the IRR Act contains provisions in which the concept of competitive interest is mentioned. Certain exemptions shall be provided in cases where it may be proven that the disclosure of information may harm the competitive advantage of the party. This is not just a problem with political parties, but also many governmental and private bodies.”"
"“It is believed that political financing is the source of corruption. Citizens have the right to know where political parties come from to collect those funds, how they spend them and the basis of their decisions. The Crony capitalism will be enormously blocked if the political parties are carried under the RTI Act.”"
"“Under the IT Act, political parties do not need to reveal the donations they get below 20,000 INR. An informal 2010 study on 6 key political parties shows that they increased Rs 700 crore. 95% of the amount was collected for amounts below Rs 20,000. There is a great possibility that political parties take advantage of this lagoon in their benefit.”"
"“Political parties declare certain promises in their manifestations. After being elected, citizens have the right to know why the promises made by political parties have not been fulfilled.”"
"“Political parties are fundamental to the functioning of democracy. Political parties continue to form the government. Government policies are then governed by the party’s ideology. Therefore, it is essential that political parties fall under the scope of the ITR.”"
"“If political parties enter under the RTI, it will affect their good internal functioning. Rivals can use RTI to malign each other. Moreover, since political parties are not directly connected to the public, an IRT would be invalid.”"
"“The Indians as a whole consider educational institutions as work machines, we hope to get unemployed and get out with employment. We do not realize that we will have to improve our skills to become worthy of employment. That’s why more than 80% of engineers are unemployed and the figures are even worse for non-engineers.”"
"""Al we have been establishing institutions at national level over the past 40 years, we have not been investing to maintain their standards. Funding is needed for quality education. Even the main Indian institutes lack adequate infrastructure, laboratories, resources, etc. And even what is available is only for the good of approving students on the exam and sitting inactive the rest of the time.”"
"Today, no problem has a unique solution and no new technology is related to a single discipline. We need multiple contributions from multiple disciplines and our institutes have failed to do so."
"“Indian students act brilliantly when they go to different countries in the field of research. This means we don’t lack talent, we lack infrastructure and a healthy environment for our sharp minds.”"
"“We have not paid our teachers on the scale of what their counterparts earn in other countries. As a result, people are reluctant to the idea of teaching as a career. We have not even managed to attract successful foreign faculty to our institutes.”"
"“To excellence in anything takes time. Through graduation, students gain both knowledge in the relevant field. Therefore, it is easier for employers to train these students for industrial requirements.”"
Any skill can be learned and dominated even if we don’t have a title in that. Programming is not an exception.
"""Even if someone has a degree in IT, you have to learn a lot to get into IT work, because there is a gap between industrial standards and the skills that are taught at engineering universities. In addition, as technology is constantly evolving, even if someone has prepared for industrial standards in their graduation, they have to learn new technologies continuously to remain relevant in the labour market. Therefore, as the learning curve will be there even for IT students, non-IT origin students can also learn these things and can enter IT jobs.”"
"“The number of IT jobs is growing at a fast pace due to the technological revolution. There will therefore be more jobs in the field of information technology. And if the recruiters are very strict about the degree, they can lose a great group of talent, which are of a non-IT background.”"
"“Now, we have so many online courses platforms through which we can learn almost any skills from experts. We can also obtain certificates if we pass the tests. So, as Tim Cook said, a 4-year title looks old and traditional.”"
"“In many of the engineering faculties in India, we can easily pass the subjects even though we don’t have much knowledge in those subjects. That’s why many companies are unable to find the right talent, even if there are so many eligible graduates. Therefore, the will to become an expert in the field is more important than a title.”"
"""If a non-IT student decides to start a career in the field of IT, the efforts they put on graduation will go empty."""
"Although new programming languages are replacing the old, the basic concepts are the same for almost all programming languages. Thus, whoever has a degree in coding will have an advantage over the student of a non-IT background.”"
"“People change career even after working on a field for several years because our interests change. Therefore, when someone can do this while having so many personal responsibilities, it’s much easier for young people to learn a new skill.”"
"“The variable salary definitely increases the productivity of employees. High-performance people feel well compensated and rewarded for their efforts, while low-performance people also feel motivated to improve.”"
"“In the variable remuneration regimes, employees feel satisfied and motivated with their work. They feel an active part of the organization, the organization recognizes them as part of their growth and appreciates their efforts.”"
"“The variable remuneration helps keep valuable employees. This helps to retain good talent for long periods of time and, therefore, to spend less on hiring new talents. This provides stability to the organization.”"
"“It has been seen that it is difficult to retain employees in times of shortage when they are in variable remuneration systems. Workers who receive commissions do good when the business is good, but they do bad when the business is bad. In slow business times, even the main sellers might have difficulties in making enough sales to earn life decently. If the market is slow and employed workers cannot earn enough, they can look for other job opportunities. In times of shortage, fixed wages can be more effective to prevent employees from going through other opportunities.”"
"Variable wages can lead to unhealthy competition among employees. They become less willing to help each other. The team’s cooperation may be negatively affected. In the long run, relationships between colleagues can become bitter. While, in fixed remuneration schemes, employees can maintain cordial relationships at the office.”"
"“In most cases, sales jobs have a variable component. This could negatively affect the employee’s attitude towards customers. They can irrationally force customers only to get profits for themselves. They could exaggerate the price to customers only to get more profits. While an employee with a fixed salary would maintain healthy and positive relationships with customers, achieving the right balance in their approach.”"
"“The enormous data we produce every day is analyzed and powered on our devices through algorithms that end up giving more and more control of our lives to gadgets. We can feel that we receive all of these services for free, but they come at the expense of our precious time and attention.”"
"“With all the data and algorithms our applications and gadgets, without our conscious knowledge, are making decisions for us. Decision making is one of the qualities that made humans different from others.”"
"“After a daily turn of 10 hours from Monday to Friday, most of us prefer to stay at home on holidays. We are surrounded by laptops, TVs and mobile devices and we use them in cycles for Netflix, sports, social networks, etc. (Thinking that we are relaxing) instead of going out. We prefer and are more comfortable with online chat rather than talking to real people. There are fewer significant relationships today due to all the previous factors. We have begun to prefer isolation.”"
"“Nuclear technology is a very efficient alternative to non-renewable energy resources. But yet, we have chosen to advance with more and more types of nuclear weapons. The same goes for almost all other inventions. Similarly, although initially AI promised better lives for us, due to AI, we have begun to lose our basic human qualities.”"
"“We have begun to lose our basic human habits and instincts, and they are actually governed by devices and applications.”"
"As Yuval Noah Harari says, “What we need now is morality and spirituality. Moral is to reduce suffering in the world. And spirituality consists in questioning and looking for answers. Religions provide us with only answers and no range of questions.”"
"Religion has served its purpose of uniting people, establishing structures in society and developing confidence and cooperation. But in the 21st century, we are prospering towards objective realities, and religion is an intersubjective reality and now the only thing it does is to create differences in the world, wash the brain to people, develop animosity for other beliefs, and provide rituals that are just attachments to become a good person. (A Muslim can pray 5 times a day; a Hindu can pray daily for hours in temples; a Christian can go to the church every day, but still, be involved in immoral activities.)"
"“In the past, every unknown thing was about religious beliefs. But now science and technology have taken care of everything. We know the causes of drought, earthquakes, wind storms, etc. They are scientific phenomena and no longer the anger of the gods.”"
"“Because of their technological nature, banks do not need physical banking branches, which helps them to save in general expenses (the cost of the company’s management). Therefore, non-banks can offer customers lower rates and higher interest rates on checks and savings accounts.”"
"“People don’t rely so much on the obank because they don’t have physical presence, which makes them a risk for customers in case of any problem or challenge. Customer service personally can seem more reliable to customers.”"
The technological literacy remains very low in India. Traditional banks can meet the banking requirements of less tech-expert customers or people in rural areas of the country who prefer face-to-face interaction with the manager.
"“Commercial banks help create credit, which leads to an increase in production, employment and consumer spending, all of which contributes to the growth of the economy.”"
"“As obancos are completely digital, they operate 24 hours a day and their services can be accessed at any time. They are easy to access from anywhere through a smartphone.”"
"“Fintech companies can open new specialized banks that address a specific type of customer needs. For example, LXME aims to become India’s first Neo bank for women, which will offer product solutions that address women’s specific financial needs and emotional preferences.”"
"“The 5G in banking will bring the so necessary financial inclusion to rural and remote populations of India, for whom access to a physical bank is not possible.”"
"“The low latency of the 5G will allow the inclusion of education in remote areas of India, where children will be able to access good quality education at home without any gap in the network between them and their favorite tutor. In addition, 5G will make it possible to use new age technologies such as AR and VR for more immersive learning in schools and colleges.”"
"“5G will greatly increase the number of networks that can be connected, managing up to a billion Internet terminals of Things, which will allow machines and humans in a factory to communicate without trouble with each other, making the business more efficient and reducing the possibility of error.”"
"“The government will be able to improve its governance and give an impulse to its digital India initiative, which aims to ensure that government services are available electronically to citizens, making the country digital power in the field of technology.”"
“Hydrogen is flammable and can cause fires or explosions. So it’s not completely safe yet.”
"“If hydrogen fuel production uses fossil fuels, it can be counterproductive. Therefore, the use of renewable energy to produce hydrogen fuel is important.”"
"Vehicles with hydrogen fuel batteries do not emit greenhouse gases. This helps to combat climate change. As many countries are choosing for the energy transition, hydrogen fuel-clean vehicles along with other alternative fuel vehicles can stretch the way towards sustainable transportation. Moreover, as these vehicles do not issue greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide, they can greatly reduce air pollution.”"
"“Fossil fuel prices are constantly rising. Therefore, if more hydrogen vehicles enter the market, the price of fossil fuels can decrease.”"
"Hydrogen vehicles are much silenter than fossil fuels. Therefore, they can also reduce the acoustic pollution.”"
"“If hydrogen fuel escapes into the air, it can increase global warming.”"
"During the pandemic era, social media helped people maintain their social life.Social media made it possible to stay connected with friends and loved ones all the time. We can easily know what is happening in your lives. It allowed us to communicate with multiple people at the same time by sharing messages.”"
"Because of social networks, we now have the opportunity to connect with many people, even if they don’t live in our area. Before social networks, we could interact with people from our town or the places we go to.”"
"By following friends on social networks and not communicating with them in private, we can only know the things they post on their accounts. You may not know much about what is really happening in your lives. That means we will not have significant connections with friends. The convenience of contacting people online made us prefer it before meeting them outside.”"
"“Some people now have social anxiety because they don’t have enough face-to-face interactions. When we avoid talking to people for a long time, we automatically develop the fear of engaging in small conversations.”"
Trolling on social media is a big threat. It is affecting the self-esteem of many people and it is also making them avoid social connections.
"“In the book ‘IGen’, it was mentioned that in the next decade we could see more young people who know the right emoji for a situation, but not the right facial expression. This can become reality if we prefer virtual life over real life.”"
"“Through close communities or microcommunities based on shared interests on social networks along with private messages, social networks gave us the opportunity to build real connections with people with whom we really can relate.”"
"“The NEET exam standardizes the entry criterion for medical education throughout the country. As a high score is required to enter the government’s medical faculty, the exam ensures meritocracy.”"
"But every year, less than 20% of students approve the exam. With this, it is obvious that the quality of medical education in other countries where Indian students are studying is not in line with medical education in India. Therefore, it is very important to take measures to provide affordable and high quality medical education in India.”"
"“As the exam requires additional study, training centers are taking advantage of the situation and are charging rupias lakhs for training for the NEET exam. Therefore, because of this, students who cannot afford coaching are in disadvantage.”"
"“Students work hard to score well in class 12 exams, but all that hard work is not recognized. And only the NEET score is considered to enter the University of Medicine, which is very unfair. In addition, the NEET exam is mainly based on the CBSE study program. Therefore, state board students have to study additional things to get a good score on the exam.”"
"""A high score in the NEET exam is required to get admission to the government medical faculty in India. It costs approximately 1.25 million rupias to study in private medical faculty in India. Thus, many students are forced to go to other countries such as China, Ukraine, Russia, the Philippines, etc. to continue medical education. In those countries, medical education costs around 35 lakhs of rupias. In addition, they allow students with low NEET scores, but above cutting brands.”"
Some people in the light of the moon to pursue their passion when the gains of their passion cannot replace the salary of their main job. Several entrepreneurs take this route and leave their jobs once they earn enough from their new.
"“According to a study published by the Academy of Management Journal in 2021, lunar lighting can provide a sense of control and motivation, which can improve employees’ productivity.”"
"“The sudden dismissals of several companies, especially during the pandemic, caused fear in many employees. And therefore several people took parallel concerts or a second job as a security network in case they were dismissed.”"
The light of the moon can help improve. Some people want to learn new skills apart from what they are working on their main job. This can help you develop your experience in your field. Some might get bored with monotonous work and therefore take second work to learn new skills and thus make your days exciting.
Companies are afraid of information and theft of sensitive data and the possibility of sharing it with their competing companies.
Some managers are concerned that employees that the moon light may not be productive in their main job due to fatigue and increased stress. There are also concerns about working for other companies during the office hours of my main job.
"“In general, companies provide several benefits to employees, such as the forecast fund, medical insurance, etc. So they feel it’s unfair when their employees focus their energy and time on a second job, which does not provide any of those benefits.”"
A cash-free economy saves so much money for governments because printing money and sending money to banks requires money and human resources. It will also be eliminated the need to buy or rent land for ATMs. International payments will also be easier because there is no need to change currencies.
Cashless transactions leave digital footprints of financial transactions. They can be used to track illegal activities. 
The COVID pandemic increased the number of non-cash transactions. They can prevent the spread of infectious diseases.
"Non-cash transactions are registered by the banks. Thus, the data will reveal the critical data of people regarding where they spend money. The government can easily access the data of any person. It can result in mass surveillance programs. This is contrary to the right to privacy. Money in cash gives us anonymousness.”"
A non-cash economy will increase the number of cyber crimes.
Technical problems in the bank can stop access to our money. This can interfere with our daily lives.
"“The refugees are displaced by force. They leave their country for several reasons, such as violence, human rights violations, war, persecution of minorities, etc. They often face life threats in their country of origin. They leave their homes and everything else in search of a safer place to live.”"
"“Today, many countries are rejecting refugees by saying they represent an economic or security threat. Only a few countries, such as Lebanon, Jordan, Turkey and Liberia, are accepting most of the refugees. Some host countries are sending refugees by force to their countries of origin saying, for example, the situation in their countries of origin is safe. Many refugees who were sent so suffered brutal violence and some people even disappeared.”"
All countries should share the responsibility of refugees. Refugees must be resettled without delay. They should be provided with skills development courses and employment opportunities to help them lead a decent life.
"“A weak global response is worsening the situation of refugees. The international community should help to reconstruct the countries affected by the war, from which refugees come, so that refugees can return in conditions of security and dignity. Refugees should not be sent by force to their country of origin.”"
"“Many developed countries are spending so much money to protect their borders, but they don’t spend any money to protect the lives of refugees. More funds are needed to protect refugees.”"
"“In general, some teachers punish students, who are not getting good outcomes on the exams, but they don’t even try to understand if they have any learning disabilities. This causes self-esteem problems in students. Psychologists can detect these learning disabilities and can detect these problems and can collaborate with teachers in developing appropriate teaching strategies for students with learning disabilities.”"
"“Many students struggle with various topics such as anxiety, self-esteem problems, problems to form friends, etc. The guidance and support are very important to help them overcome these problems. Therefore, educational institutions should have mental health professionals to help students.”"
"“In 2020, an average of 34 students committed suicide every day due to several reasons, such as exam pressure and relationship problems. Therefore, it is very important to provide support to them in educational institutions. Counselors can help you cope with pressures and improve your mental health. If the student suffers from mental health problems such as severe depression, the counselors will take measures so that they are treated by psychiatrists.”"
"“The coveted pandemic affected many people’s mental health. As schools and colleges were closed for a long time, many students felt isolated and that caused an even more negative impact on mental health. As schools and colleges are reopened, students need help to adapt to the new norm.”"
"“Some students don’t even understand what they’re going on, they may not even know how to ask for help. Having a counselor in your educational institution will help you greatly in understanding your problems. They will also learn to ask for advice and help.”"
"“When university education is free, the number of graduates will increase drastically. Nowadays, many people have no access to higher education. Many students do not join universities due to the financial situation of their parents. Free education will be very helpful for them.”"
"“At present, the rich are becoming richer and the poor are becoming poorer. A free university education will reduce social inequality also because as everyone can study and learn the skills at the university, everyone will have equal opportunities to sit in the career of their choice.”"
"""Some students are taking educational loans to study and then have to work hard to pay their loans. Many people are compelled to accept jobs immediately after university to pay the loans. But with free education, they will have freedom in career options such as choosing a job or becoming entrepreneurs or experimenting with concerts, etc.”"

"“Nearly 3 Lakh people were employed in the petard industry in these places, and 5 Lakh people in packaging, transportation, distribution and sale of these cookies. Therefore, the ban would also mean a huge unemployment in these states.”"
“Bursting cookies in Diwali has always been on the list of tasks in each family. A Deepavali without petards will definitely be a cutting in entertainment and recreation for children as well as the elderly.”
"“The ban on petards in some places that currently have pollution in their peak such as Delhi-NCR will obviously eradicate the poisonous emission of gases that has deadly effects throughout the balanced ecosystem. The highest level of particulate recorded in Delhi was 2.5 in 2016, making Delhi the world’s most polluted city in terms of air pollution. The “Central Pollution Control Board” also stated that the level of sulfur dioxide in the air rises enormously between 9 p.m. and midnight during Deepavali.”"
"“Regulated cookies on the market include chemical components such as salitre, carbon and sulfur. When they are fully burned, dangerous oxides of gases are emitted that cause asphyxia, reduce visibility and other health risks. Medical experts say the air is contaminated with toxic gases and remains for days after Diwali. Toxic elements that reach the lungs cannot be removed afterwards and can cause serious health problems. This will have long-term effects on children.”"
"“With the ban, religious feelings are also activated. In 2017, the Hindu community raised questions about the prohibition of Christmas trees in Christmas, or the killing of lamb in Eid, or colors in Holi, etc., thinking it was against their community practices.”"
India is the second most populated country in the world. It is already difficult for the Indian government to provide food security and basic needs to the entire people of India. Adding more burden to this will worsen the situation.
The hosted refugees will cause the resettlement of some Indians. The Indian government tried to give refuge to the Rohingya by resettling some in the Jammu region. This may not be the right step and will cause anxiety to the resettled Indians.
"“The Rohingya have their own ethnic and cultural set. By accepting them, we will only add more culture to India’s already vast culture.”"
"“To let the Rohingya return to the place where they don’t receive recognition means more loss of human lives, and in greater extent. The population of the Rohingya is 1.1 million, and if violence and torture continue on them then no one will be left in the community.”"
The acceptance of the Rohingya will definitely give a good impression of the hospitality of our country to the foreign land. This will improve India’s chances of obtaining the status of a permanent member of the United Nations Security Council (CSNU).
"“Accepting refugees who escape death situations is undoubtedly an act of humanity. The Rohingya people have been brutally treated by the government due to racism. As a neighboring country, we should be accepting those people who are in profound anxiety.”"
Permiting refugees is a potential threat to the security of any country. Refugees can be easily caught by terrorists. They can take advantage of the situation and carry out illegal activities using refugees.
"Consensual sex can also be called rape if the wife is willing to submit a false case. There will be no evidence to prove whether it is consensual or not. Punishing men based on the mercy words of the wives is completely incorrect, because of the assumption that women do not lie. Good and bad are not related to gender. There are also criminals.”"
"The most unfairly used law in the Indian judicial system is article 498A, which allows women to submit a case against a husband and his family in case of harassment by the dote. Many women are using this law to extortion money and property from their grandchildren. If the law on marital rape comes into force, many innocent men will be in danger.”"
"Sexual violence violates human rights, regardless of the relationship between the criminal and the victim. IPC 375, which typizes rape as a crime, discriminates married women for using the section on their husbands. Although one can submit a case under the law of domestic violence for marital rape, not qualifying marital rape as a crime will dissuade the victims to submit cases. All the laws of the planet are likely to be misused. That doesn’t mean we don’t have to have laws to avoid false cases.”"
"“There will be no sense of security. We cannot sleep quietly because the value of cryptocurrency continues to fluctuate. Standard currencies fluctuate as well, but not as high as cryptocurrencies. If the value of the standard currency decreases, we can still allow ourselves to live in our country, because the decrease in the value of the currency affects all fields. For example, if the prices of foodstuffs rise, our wages also do so. But if the value of cryptocurrencies like bitcoin falls, we’ll lose our hard earned money.”"
"“The future belongs to technology. Cryptocurrencies facilitate financial transactions between couples. This coin can be sent from anywhere in the world to anywhere in the world. Therefore, there will be no currency exchange struggle like dollars for the Rupee, etc. As you travel around the world, there will be no obstacle to exchange our currencies with local currencies.”"

"“Reality shows exercise an enormous pressure on the participants to act well every time. Children cannot handle this stress, and this can cause mental health problems. Almost all reality shows involve the process of eliminating participants one by one on each level. Facing the defeat against everyone is not so easy for children. This can cause emotional impact on children.”"
"“Today, many songs and dances in the movies are not supposed to be seen by children. Singing and dancing these obscene songs will explode the children’s innocence and create confusion in their minds.”"
"“Triple Talaq is a provision of the Islamic personal law that allows men to divorce from their wives saying Talaq three times. Triple Talaq violates fundamental rights such as the right to equality, the right to non-discrimination and the right to live with dignity because this provision is only available for men and not for women. Women are subject to living with the fear of being divorced unilaterally by their husbands. This violates their right to live with dignity.”"
"The triple talaq must occur in three stages with time lagoons. This allows time for reconciliation and arbitration. Since instant divorce is a misuse of the triple talaq, prohibiting disposition itself is not the solution.”"
"“Triple Talaq does not follow the Coran guidelines of discussion, arbitration to resolve disputes, divorce witnesses, the specified time period to reconcile, or even a genuine attempt to resolve differences.”"

Why is it all seen in a sexual nature? Brahmacharya does not mean that women cannot worship God. Brahmacharya means observing the celibate. This does not mean that there should not be female devotees in reproductive age. Strong mind people don’t understand the difference between devotion and sexual attraction.
"“Other temples also prohibit women, and other temples prohibit men. If it was the same situation with Sabarimala, people’t have been bothered by it. But treating menstruation as impure and prohibiting women in reproductive age is regressive and it is necessary to address it. Menstruation is a biological process. Not allowing menstrual women in temples sends a wrong message to people and to future generations.”"
Sabarimala temple is taking government funds and therefore the state government has the right to make changes in the law for the temple.

"“These competitions and beauty competitions have a very wrong influence on society, as we all quickly follow the media trends. All this is basically sending the wrong message to our girls of the youngest generation where they are made to understand that being perfect and beautiful is extremely necessary. This affects your self-esteem and can even cause depression.”"
"They promote aesthetic surgeries. Women these days, are ready to spend thousands of dollars on getting hair extensions, false teeth, botox injections, body implants, aerosol bruns, brand clothes and makeup products. This could be extremely expensive to pay and such expenses are endless. Cindy Jackson is a television star. It has a world record of 52 plastic surgeries performed by it. Some women may become addicted to such practices and then yours don’t look back. This is the direct influence of the importance of society for beauty.”"

"“The IPC 375, which classifies rape as a crime, discriminates married women so that they do not use the section relating to their husbands.”"
"“Today, every man is considered a potential violator. If a woman makes a complaint of false sexual abuse against a man for revenge or any other reason, society is more likely to believe the words of the woman. The society and the media expose the accused before the investigation. This kind of attitude of society helps the victims in genuine cases. But the scope of false cases is ignored. However, the same is not the case with complaints against women. If the complaint is against a woman, people doubt the ingenuity of the case. What if the case of sexual harassment against a man is false? Some people think men can take anything. Cases of false sexual abuse will result in irreversible loss of reputation and will cause mental agony to the accused and his family.”"
"“In India, many false cases of domestic violence are being denounced. The girl can drag her cousins to the court, but the same is not true with a child. In many cases of domestic violence, the survivors have not even stayed with the couple, but are reserved to ""influence"" the child. Does the girl’s parents not ‘influence’ her? And the most sad thing is that the girl can complain against her cousin and her cousin's husband also under domestic violence, even if they don't stay in her house. Women can be as cruel as men by harassing their partner.”"

"“The current subsidies must be replaced with a modular incentive system, as this allows farmers to choose sustainable, responsible solutions from the environmental, social and financial point of view, which are already available, such as natural sequence agriculture, regenerative agriculture, permaculture, etc.”"
"In Germany, 60% of the land is used for animal food. To determine the amount of the subsidy received by an exploitation, the surface of the exploitation is decisive. In other words, a great amount of land, a great amount of subsidy. This leads to a cheap animal feed and, ultimately, to an intense livestock. Thus, if the State subsidizes animal food and livestock on the basis of its size and not on the basis of the sustainability and well-being of the animals, the concept of intensive livestock will be supported.”"
Not just the batteries. The EU should have a global policy with a clear goal of limiting and reducing the expected obsolescence.

Brexit was the decision of generally uninformed or misinformed people who cannot be guilty for it. Especially those who voted to stay or those who could not vote at all.

"“It’s just anecdotal evidence, but I’ve noticed in the secondary schools in my area that migrants’ children are more able to participate in extra-school activities when their language develops more. Children, of course, continue to go to school daily, which means they automatically participate in language classes. However, seeing the positive results in language learning in these children, I can imagine that their parents would benefit in the same way if they were given the opportunity to follow language lessons (ideally low-budget/free).”"

Most of the times migrants have trouble adapting to society due to language barrier and hatred. Providing them language lessons could reduce the tensions around migration and improve migrants’ integration.
"“The knowledge of the host country’s language is essential for integration. When migrants understand the local language, studies show that their values tend toward those of the host countries over time.”"

The Junker Commission has tried to reform the Blue Card Directive in order to create a new EU-wide simplified visa category, similar to the short-term Schengen visa. The holder of the new blue card visa would have all the EU labour market at its disposal.”"
"“For too long, the EU has seen a net exodus or a brain escape of highly qualified people.”"
"“In comparison with most English-speaking countries, Europe has been quite shy by attracting talent around the world. Very few people know and use the Blue Card of the EU. The EU is a choice destination for migration and refugees from developing countries and some neighboring countries.”"
"“The future is the ‘work mobility’, so we need to simplify taxation, improve the opportunities for distance work and allow the international hiring of companies.”"
"“Many migrants simply refuse to fight to change things in their own countries. Once a migrant said to me, 'I want what you have, why should I sweat to build it again in my country when here is ready to be taken?' No, thank you.”"
"“If we need labor, we should seek Europeans, not Africans, Arabs and Muslims.”"
"“People born in Africa or poor countries are looking for a better place for their children to grow up, where there is no war and where there is food, good education and health systems.”"
"“Promoting, organizing and directing mass migration is a crime against humanity. Lukashenko is committing exactly this horrible crime. But it’s also George Soros and his NGOs who participate in the same hybrid war against Europe when they bring those migrants to our coasts.”"
The EU will either be a force against illegal migration or it will no longer exist in the future.
"""Europe is rich enough to welcome many immigrants and if they are allowed to work, they will even generate their own income and profits for the country they arrive."""
"“You are justifying the genocide of indigenous Europeans who, when asked, always reject these ‘refugees’.”"
"“As EU citizens, we should never forget how privileged we are and that we have the human obligation to help the others in need.”"
"It is necessary that the Member States better share their efforts to receive asylum seekers when they arrive at the EU borders and do not leave this responsibility in the hands of the first-line countries.  The EU should develop a joint approach to support the first-line countries in order to ensure that asylum seekers receive adequate attention, assistance and protection at their arrival and are rapidly distributed uniformly throughout the EU to determine their status.”"
The deep causes of leaving their countries of origin should not be overlooked. The EU and its Member States should double their efforts to make their countries of origin more habitable.
"“Successful migration is only possible when there is a vacancy in the host country, and the migrant has the required qualifications. Unlimited mass migration is the biggest existential threat to the EU.  Even more than the CO2 threat.”"
"“A greater illegal and legal migration will lead to more unemployment, lower wages, more insecurity and less sustainable social systems.”"
"Respect for human rights and the exchange of efforts, as well as solidarity, should be of common sense in the EU Member States. Unfortunately, they haven’t done it yet.”"
"“I do not agree, each country must be sovereign to establish its immigration policy and no EU quotas should be accepted.”"
"“Thro the EU, young people are still facing a number of major challenges to enter and a stable position on the labour market. They do not easily obtain good quality jobs with worthy wages and continue to face significant exclusion from regular employment, good quality education, training opportunities and adequate inclusion and coverage in national social protection systems. Young women and migrants are affected. Therefore, we need a fairer migration policy, but we also take into account the needs (and challenges) of migrants in other political spheres.”"
The shameful (and practical) policy of Europe in these days towards migrants is contradictory with the respect we have to show to the world’s citizens. And it is not in accordance with the fundamental rights that the EU is supposed to implement. 
"In the EU labour market, we will need more workers from outside Europe to continue the level of economic activities we are planning. "
"“We need a balance between solidarity and responsibility. A reform of the Dublin system is needed, but the review work has not moved a centimeter since 2019. It has been attempted to advance in the adoption of a common European asylum system and in the creation of a EU-wide resettlement system with sufficient financial incentives, while emphasizing its objective of closely following the migration routes and keeping the situation aware. This question must be improved at European level, since we never know when a new crisis will be in our hands, this time caused by climate change and environmental disasters that force people to enter the diaspora and to seek a safe shelter.”"
The EU should treat economic migrants more carefully. It cannot be the solution for the ageing of the European population. We need to focus more on border control to stop illegal migration. 
"“The human rights-based approach should be the basic principle. Legal guidelines are necessary for the entry and promotion of an integration policy based on the respect of the rights and equal treatment of both local workers and migrants, as fundamental instruments for dealing with the social effects of migration flows.”"
"“Migrant workers are excessively represented in the most precarious jobs, too often they are poorly paid, work in intolerable working conditions and live in horrible housing facilities. Workers are vulnerable to abuse and exploitation. And they continue to encounter unhuman working and living conditions because there is no effective application. Trade unions are often not allowed to work in precarious workplaces and therefore migratory workers cannot be adequately informed of their labor and trade unions rights. Third-country nationals are even more vulnerable than EU migrant/mobile workers.”"
"“Al the number of migration workers in the RCC has grown tremendously, there is no adequate policy to protect their rights. Everyone in Europe should have the same rights as workers, regardless of their origin. Since migration is a matter that all countries deal with, we must find a common EU response.”"
"The Dublin Agreement leaves the EU Member States with a completely single external border to address the immigration challenge. This must stop! Not only because solidarity in the EU is important for its cohesion, but also because the inevitable overload of states that remain alone with this challenge creates intolerable situations for refugees.”"
"“Before we focus on ensuring that immigrants have good conditions in the EU, we must first focus on ensuring that our own citizens can live respected lives in their own countries. Countries where they paid taxes andined their own workforce. So they receive support when they get sick, when they need help to take care of their children, and when one day they retire. The EU has not yet achieved this properly in all Member States. As such, those Member States should focus on repairing and improving the situation of their own people first and once those countries are at the level of standards and have free resources, then we can talk about improving the situation of immigrants.”"
"“Every country should have the right to choose on the basis of a democratic vote, how many immigrants want to accept.  The issue of immigrants depends on the reality and culture of each country: this must be managed at a local level.”"
"“We should not bring the problem to Europe, but we should help wherever it is necessary in your region!”"
"“Giving more rights to immigrants will lead to forced displacement and the eventual elimination of indigenous Europeans. This is criminal. If what is happening to the Uighur and Tibetans in China is genocide, then it is also that. This idea proposal is not basic, it is an atrophy to hide the fact that our immigration policies are completely anti-democratic and forced to native Europeans.”"
"A fair, sustainable and open Europe benefits everyone.  Our common future requires actions to put human rights, solidarity and social justice in the forefront of the agenda.”"
The nations must have the last word about who they want to allow to live in their sovereign territories. 
"“Massive immigration is the greatest existential threat to the EU.  The UNCHR already has 70 million registered refugees, mainly from Africa and the ME. In Africa, 400 million people like to come to the EU.  Almost all people lack useful education.  There is no other solution than a total stop of immigration.”"
"“I agree, but only with one condition: that each euro is spent under the joint control of local and European officials. There is so much corruption in Africa that unlike every 100 euros sent there, at least 80 would end in the pockets of corrupt officials. And in that case, it is better not to send anything.”"
The European Union must be a removal of unity and humanity. 
The migration pressure from Africa to Europe is due to a significant difference in the quality of life perceived. It is in the interest of the EU and its Member States to reduce that difference by working with the UA to level and develop African nations.
"“Yes, and it should be paid to all EU citizens. People with a lower CO2 footprint – generally low-income families – would benefit a lot from it and would be encouraged to invest in cleaner energy, heating, etc.”"
"“Esperanto must be promoted as an international frank language. Esperanto is an efficient and expressive means of intercultural communication, allowing high degrees of inclusion.”"
"“Give those who want to come a fair and secure opportunity to do so and send back those who really hurt their society. Training, support and opportunities. I think the majority will pay with their contributions.”"
We already have successful programs for refugee camps students. Improve that.
"“Yes, although some countries have other problems at the moment. Give Member States the possibility of choosing: more refugees and more money and support or less refugees and less money and support. Very simple.”"
"""Take as an example aircraft - how is it so, that it's so common to be able to search tickets using one of the many web pages or applications, but in reality we can't do the same for trains? The trains are more ecological.”"
If we have a EU citizenship we will have a EU country and the EU has already shown not to be good to deal with the problems and is extremely anti-democratic and does not listen to citizens.
There are countries like Greece to which I don’t know there is any railway connection from other EU countries. This should be a top priority for the EU! 
This would help to plan the most efficient and economical itinerary. 
"“Yes, but the tax should be progressive per capita. This will ensure that we make the most of the excessive use of resources and will prevent the increase of inequality in the wealth of the poor.”"
"“According to. Only if we prove that criminals do not take place in the EU, we will be able to convince our citizens that refugees are not a major threat. Making the verification process that every refugee has to pass through the public would also help to get rid of the feeling that anyone can come here and we have to close our borders.”"
Why should every EU country be sovereign in energy production? Not all countries are sovereign in this sense. We have to take advantage of the geographical potential of the European continent to find pragmatic solutions.
"Not only for commitment, but also for planning. Especially if an immigrant is captured planning a terrorist act, he must be permanently expelled from the EU.”"
Most experts agree that an EU carbon tax would be an efficient way to reduce our CO2 emissions. 
"“In my view, it will be essential to impose some compensatory exactions on products from third countries to ensure that they do not have a competitive advantage.”"
"Eventually, the best solution would be a global agreement (as within the OECD and with similar mentality) as the world’s minimum tax type.”"
"“But of course yes! If the eurocrates were concerned about what people want, they would be asked.”"
"""The cheap and affordable train trips approach everyone, regardless of the borders"""
"“We should think about more opportunities to legally enter the EU. Many people come illegally because we reject them the opportunities to come, stay a while to work or to receive education and return later. People die for these fools.”"
"“I recently read that especially African families tend to send their smarter and better educated young people abroad to improve the family situation. These people are desperately needed both for the future of their countries of origin and for our future. We need trained and educated people in many sectors, but we send them back to their countries of origin, because they were unfortunate enough to be refugees.”"
"""It must work as with air transport: Reserve a coherent journey from A to B operated by different companies, and make sure that if something goes wrong, there will be a solution (reservation,...)."""
Nuclear energy is not green due to radioactive waste.
"“I agree, no one should emigrate to a country if they commit a crime.”"
"“Nuclear energy is simply too expensive and therefore economically not viable. According to RethinkX researchers, in the next ten years there will be a clean energy interruption that will leave empty investments in oil, coal and nuclear energy.”"
Africa and the Middle East have the highest birth rate in the world. Africa has up to seven children per woman. The EU has 1.55.  This high birth rate keeps them poor. There is almost nothing that the EU can do about it.”
The EU is not responsible for the whole world.
All refugee camps must be closed. And the illegal returned to the last country they left. 
Helping migrants to learn the language and culture of the country in which they live is crucial for the success of integration. The language and standards of the labour market and the workplace should also be incorporated.
Africa is the only continent in which the number of young people continues to increase. 
Talking about what happened in the past between Africa and Europe is useless. All the slaves and their owners died long ago. You can’t blame your grandchildren.
"“If there are language problems, we have to work on national integration systems, for example. In France, where English is being thought in French. The language.”"
We already have English as a language of exchange.
"""English is ideal as it is spoken internationally as a language of trade, travel and political exchange. Esperanto is not that.”"
Migration is a part of human being and has always occurred throughout history.    
"“The EU needs a human, civilized and legal way of managing migration, whether for economic reasons or to seek international protection.”"
The EU member states have to rise together instead of attempting to impose the burden on each other or between the external nations.
"“We have to accept more immigrants to fight the ageing of European population. Immigrants also age, but before that they usually have children.”"
"“Paying taxes is not enough, if you want to become a citizen with full rights you need to fully embrace the country you live in.”"
"“If young Europeans live abroad, they will feel racism on their own in the country in which they live.”"
"“No puppy would like to live with eagles or gorrions.  That is nature, not desires.”"
Migrants lack critical thinking.  
Migrants will voluntarily risk their lives.
Migrants depend on the social systems of other countries.
Migrants are selling drugs.
The EU should recognize that increasing birth rates in Europe and supporting European families to have (more) children is the most appropriate long-term solution.
"“To increase the birth rate and support young families, Hungary should be an example. We should not depend on migration for this."""
The emphasis on negative stereotypes towards migrants comes mainly from people who don’t know the Africans or other migrants or refugees. 
"“Migrants have a huge amount to offer in energy, new ideas and cultures. Why is this emphasis on the imaginary 'tomas'?"""
"“If asylum applications are submitted from abroad, the costs for EU taxpayers to process asylum seekers are reduced.”"
"“If asylum applications are submitted from abroad, the humanitarian crisis in the Mediterranean Sea will be ended.”"
"“When asylum applications are submitted from abroad, the safety risks of asylum seekers are significantly reduced.”"
"“Massive migration is a hybrid war against our stability. State agents, such as Morocco, Belarus and Turkey, have already taken advantage of mass migration.”"
"“Massive migration is a hybrid war against our stability. NGOs organize, finance and promote migration to gain benefits.”"
"“Migration is completely out of control. The EU refuses to see its magnitude. Thousands of people like to migrate. All people without the right language and adequate education. The large number of immigrants threatens the existence of EU societies, through crime, poverty and housing shortage.”"
 Refugees can get a visa at an embassy in one of the 54 African countries. All other immigrants must be returned within a week from their arrival.
"“There are states in the European Union that do not want any asylum seekers in their country. For example, Denmark returns all the Syrians and other Arabs."""
Fear of the unknown is a normal behavior. It has saved our race from ages that began when mankind was a simple monkey among others. 
"“In addition, when fear is strengthened by facts such as increasing violence in all countries with a high number of immigrants and women’s rape, it’s not a problem of ‘perception’ but a simple reality.”"
To stop all immigration from non-European or non-European countries from the first world to the EU.
"“Instead of trying to stop immigration, we need to create a good integration plan and at the same time improve the living conditions in the countries of the 2nd and 3rd world. This includes the struggle for climate justice and the decrease in the unfair distribution of wealth among countries.”"
There must be some rules for integration: Integration does not mean giving up European values and culture.
There must be some rules for integration: Integration does not mean completely open borders.
I am glad to see that the idea of dealing with all the immigration from non-European or non-First World countries remains strong. This message must be very clearly transmitted to Brussels. 
No more non-European immigration. Native Europeans say no.
European citizens are the future of Europe! 
"“Only argumenting to keep migrants out is very myope and unhistorical. By keeping migrants out, the migration pressure will not decrease. So, what do you suggest for next year, within 10 years? """
"“Migration has been a fact of history and successful societies have found ways to turn migration into a fort. In our case, to relieve the current long-term challenge, we need to relieve the migration pressure making it attractive that migrants remain in their place and help develop their own countries. A project so useful, a European Maritime Plan for Africa would be a good project to invest in. The long-term performance of the investment would be more than financial: a friendly neighboring continent, good relationships, access to the African market and natural resources. This is not a short-term solution. There is no short-term solution. We have to play the long game!”"
"Why can Arab countries not host refugees from other Arab countries? The same habits, religion and have enough wealth.”"
This is the topic in the policy and the formulation of public sector policies. Goals will not be pursued. There are no problems to be solved. It is the nature of the beast. Balance of conflicting interests. 
A humanitarian association that helps a migrant enter the EU illegally should lose its government/EU funding.
"“We must stop all immigration from non-European or non-world countries belonging to the EU. However, if we want to stop this immigration, we must stop its causes. In fact, it is the war, poverty and European, Chinese and American neocolonialism that makes the peoples of the countries of Africa and the Middle East flee to Europe. Thus, Europe must finally take responsibility and protect these countries from corruption, war and neocolonialism and help them start their economy.”"
Migration from countries with incompatible cultural values and ideologies should be limited or stopped in order to ensure social cohesion in Europe. The antiquated ideologies and regressive values should not have cabin in Europe. 
"“Migrants who are already here (legally) must be taught Western values so that they and their families can integrate/assimile, as the old saying says, ‘When they are in Rome, do what the Romans do.’”"
"“What we are seeing now are the first waves of a human tsunami. In sub-Saharan Africa, over the years the population will have increased to 2 billion people.  That’s more than people living in the EU and the U.S. today.  At the same time, the population in the EU is decreasing. If we keep the border open, the EU as a viable society will disappear.  There is not much future for young Europeans.”"
The entry into the EU without permission automatically excludes a person from any right to receive asylum. 
"“We must put an end to all the lagoons, for example, by automatically rejecting asylum applications from anyone who enters illegally in Europe.”"
"“In conclusion, we should say, ‘Europeans go home. Come home, leave all the parts of the world where we are doing business, exploiting cheap labour, rare minerals, selling weapons, invading foreign countries and exporting democracy, etc."
"“The EU’s demographic problems, which are real, must be resolved by fostering procration and a generous family policy, not through migration. We must celebrate maternity and mothers. We must realize that raising a child leads to serious costs in today’s Europe.”"
"“Multiculturalism creates chaos wherever it exists. Stockholm of Sweden has become the capital of the Western rape, and the number of bombs and shots has been shot as well in that country. France is bordering the civil war, whole territories are no longer under state control. Europe needs to stop migration and asylum indefinitely. We have to put our European peoples in the first place, just as everyone is doing as our civilization commits suicide on the basis of values imposed by Santuronian narcissists.”"
"""There's nothing wrong in not wanting your continent to become chaos and put your people first, every civilization in this world takes that idea as obvious. We have to negotiate remigration agreements with third countries to send their nationals back and we need to use Frontex to push any immigrant who comes to our borders.”"
EU leaders do not comply with their fundamental obligations: to monitor their borders and to protect their own citizens. Thirty years after the introduction of Schengen. 
Immigration should not be part of humanitarian aid. Humanitarian aid should be delivered directly to Africa and Asia. The agreement with Turkey should ultimately be abolished.
“Europe must remain in Europe and it should not be imposed on citizens a cultural and religious change they do not want and that is a madness. See what the Arab or north African countries have become after 1400 years of Islam.”
A humanitarian association to help a migrant illegally enter the EU should be required to provide financial support in decent conditions. 
"“A humanitarian association that helps a migrant enter the EU illegally should also be trapped before the court for not bringing the illegals to the nearest secure port. In 90% of cases, the nearest port is in Africa."
We have to end all funding for NGOs and all migration organizations within the EU. Then we can talk about how to help the people who are already here and how to help the real people in need.
We have to agree that people who do not respect our immigration law are detained in repatriation centers.
The country of origin must be absolutely the most important criterion to decide who we let go into our countries. 160 Franceses would remain alive if we put the well-being of our people above the people whose countries the Americans have bombed in pieces.
“It’s time to be honest about this! Europeans have the right to self-determination like any other country! This is our home and a home for all is a home for no one.”
Our European continent is debtful and has no resources to address people who have never paid taxes and are still making case omission of our laws! We already have enough poor in Europe and we have to take care of them!
"“I do not agree to dismiss people from their right to asylum and a right to live in the EU because they came illegally. Instead, it would suggest that it is easier to migrate legally. In this way there would be no need to migrate illegally and risk your life while you do it.”"
"“The refugee division is a long-term plan. But at the end, no group involved agreed to these plans. Some countries don’t like these people at all.”"
