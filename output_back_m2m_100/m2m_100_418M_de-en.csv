"In light of the increasing threat by terrorists, terrorism needs to be strictly combated. Therefore, a strengthening of the UAPA is necessary."
"""Today, India has no well-built infrastructure to ensure data security. On the other hand, the industrial countries already have efficient infrastructure. So, if we rush towards data localization, this may not be a wise step. Without efficient infrastructure, data is vulnerable to cyber attacks. And the risk is great here because it is financial data. But how the laws are made, it’s a big challenge to develop efficient infrastructure at a faster pace.”"
"“The storage of data in India means higher operating costs for the operators of payment systems. In other countries, they have cheaper alternatives. And even in cross-border transactions, they need to store the data in two places, which increases the cost. It is likely that these additional costs will be transferred to the consumers.”"
"""Data localization laws lead to the construction of several data centers on the site. This will create a lot of jobs and greatly help the country’s economy. It will also promote innovation in this area that will lead to cost-effective solutions.”"
"“With the investigation of crimes it will be necessary to access the payment data. If the data is stored abroad, it is very difficult to obtain permission from that country for access to the data. This leads to delays in the resolution of crimes. If the data is stored here in our country, this problem will be avoided.”"
India is a large consumer market for many foreign companies. India and other developing countries recognize the economic value of data and the importance of data localization. Data localization will benefit domestic companies and the country’s economy. And we can also ensure the security of the data.
"“The data is considered a ‘new form of wealth’. Companies generally use data to understand consumer requirements and influence their behavior. New products can be developed by analysing the data to meet the needs of consumers. The data has an economic value. In general, the industrial countries take advantage of this opportunity with their well-developed infrastructure.”"
"“We are in a globalized world. Currently, the world runs on the free flow of people, goods, services and data. Data localization laws seem to be part of the protectionist policy, which is a threat to the free flow of data.”"
"“The United States is against data localization laws. Recently at the G20 summit, U.S. President Donald Trump spoke against data localization. His attitude is natural because it increases the operating costs of U.S. companies. The bilateral relations between India and the United States are important for both countries because we are in the export and import of IT services, professionals and goods, etc. They are flooded. So imposing data localization laws without threatening Indo-US relations is another challenge.”"

"“The law is very clear that RTI is not only dealing with government agencies alone. It is also intended for non-governmental organizations that are essentially financed and controlled by the government. There are numerous subsidies (including tax exemptions) that political parties enjoy, thus they are essentially funded by the government.”"
"“Political parties are independent bodies, they do not have to be liable to the public. They were not made by the Constitution or an act of Parliament.”"
"“According to the RTI law, these organizations, where there is public interest, must be transparent and subject to the law. Today there are a number of private organizations, whether partially funded or fully; schools, hospitals, etc. that are under the RTI law and not just government organizations.”"
“There are appropriate provisions in the Income Tax Act and with the Election Commission so that people can have all the information they want.”
"The RTI Act contains provisions in Section 8, in which the concept of competitive interest is mentioned. Certain exceptions shall be granted in cases where it can be demonstrated that the dissemination of information may harm the competitive advantage of the party. This is a problem not only with the political parties, but also with many government and private bodies.”"
"It is believed that political financing is the source of corruption. Citizens have the right to know where the political parties get these funds, how they spend these funds and on the basis of their decisions. The Crony capitalism is enormously blocked when political parties are brought under the RTI Act.”"
"According to the IT law, political parties do not have to disclose donations they receive under INR 20,000. An informal study conducted in 2010 on 6 major political parties shows that they raised Rs 700 crore. 95% of the amount was raised by amounts below Rs 20,000. There is a great possibility that the political parties will take advantage of this gap.”"
"“Political parties express certain promises in their manifests. After the election, citizens have the right to know why the promises made by the political parties have not been fulfilled.”"
“Political parties are of central importance for the functioning of democracy. Political parties continue to form the government. The government policy is then governed by the party ideology. This will make it essential for the political parties to fall under the field of the RTI.”
"“If political parties fall under the RTI, this will affect their smooth internal functioning. Rivals can use RTI to offend each other. Since the political parties are not directly connected to the public, a RTI would be invalid.”"
"“In the whole, educational institutions are viewed as work machines, we expect to get unemployed and get out with work. We do not realize that we need to improve our skills to become worthy of employment. This is why more than 80% of engineers are unemployed and the figures for non-engineers are even worse.”"
"Although we have founded institutions at national level over the past 40 years, we have not invested in keeping their standards. Qualitative education requires funds. Even the Indian top institutions lack infrastructure, laboratories, resources, etc. And even what is available is only to keep the students in the exam and sit off the rest of the time.”"
"“Today, no problem has a single solution and no new technology is connected with a single discipline. We need several contributions from several disciplines, and our institutions have not done that.”"
"""Indian students provide brilliant achievements when they go to different countries in the field of research. This means we don’t lack talent, we lack infrastructure and a healthy environment for our sharp heads.”"
“We have not paid our teachers at the level that their colleagues in other countries deserve. The result is that people hesitate on the idea of teaching as a career. We’ve also failed to attract successful foreign faculty to our institutions.”
"“To excellence in everything takes time. Through the graduation, the students acquire so much knowledge in the relevant field. So it’s easier for employers to train these students for the industrial requirements.”"
"“Every skill can be learned and mastered, even if we don’t have a degree in it. Programming is no exception.”"
"""Even if someone has an IT degree, he has to learn so many things to get into the IT job because there is a gap between the industrial standards and the skills taught in engineering schools. Furthermore, as the technology is constantly developing, even if someone has prepared for industrial standards in his degree, they need to constantly learn new technologies to remain relevant on the labour market. So as the learning curve will also be there for IT students, students from non-IT backgrounds can also learn these things and enter IT jobs.”"
"“The number of IT jobs is growing rapidly due to the technological revolution. There will be more jobs in the IT sector. And if the recruits are very strictly above the degree, they may miss a large pool of talents that have a non-IT background. """
"""Now we have so many online courses platforms through which we can learn almost every skill from experts. We can also receive certificates if we pass the tests. So, as Tim Cook said, a 4-year degree seems old and traditional. """
"""In many of the Indian engineering colleges, we can easily transfer the subjects, even if we don't have much knowledge in these subjects. That’s why many companies are unable to find the right talents, even if there are so many qualified graduates. So the willingness to become experts in this field is more important than a degree. """
"""If a student from non-IT background has decided to start a career in the IT field, the efforts they put in graduation will go out of mind."""
"Although the new programming languages replace the old, the basic concepts for almost all programming languages are the same. So whoever has a degree in coding has a advantage over the student from a non-IT background.”"
"“People change careers even after working in a field for several years because our interests change. So if someone can do this while he has so many personal duties, it’s much easier for young people to learn a new skill.”"
"“Variable salary definitely increases the productivity of employees. Strong people feel rewarded and rewarded for their efforts, while weak people feel motivated to improve.”"
"“In variable salary systems, employees feel satisfied and motivated with their work. They believe to be an active part of the organization, the organization recognizes it as part of its growth and appreciates its efforts.”"
“Variable payments help inining valuable employees. This helps to keep good talents for a long time and thus fewer spending on setting new talents. This ensures stability for the organization.”
"It has been found that it is difficult to keep workers in weak times when they are on variable wages systems. Workers who receive provisions do good when the business is good, but they do bad when the business is bad. In times of slow business, even top sellers may have difficulties in selling enough to earn a decent maintenance. If the market is slow and contractors can’t earn enough, they can look for other employment opportunities. In poor times, fixed wages can be more effective to prevent workers from using other options.”"
"Variable payments can lead to unhealthy competition between employees. They are less willing to help each other. Team cooperation can have a negative impact. In the long run, the relationships between colleagues can become bitter. While workers at fixed wage systems are able to maintain heartbreaking relationships at the office.”"
"“Most sales jobs have a variable component. This could have a negative impact on the employee’s attitude towards customers. You can force the customers irrationally to only make profits for themselves. You could exaggerate the price to the customers just to make more profits. While a worker with a fixed salary would maintain healthy and positive relationships with the customers, the right balance in their approach.”"
"“The enormous data we produce every day is analyzed and inserted through algorithms into our devices, which ultimately gives gadgets more and more control over our lives. We may feel like we get all of these services for free, but they come at the expense of our precious time and attention.”"
"With all the data and algorithms, our apps and gadgets, without our conscious knowledge, make decisions for us. Decision making is one of the qualities that distinguishes people from others."
"“After a daily 10-hour layer from Monday to Friday, most of us prefer to stay at home on holidays. We surround ourselves with laptops, TV and mobile and use them in cycles for Netflix, sports, social media, etc. (Think that we relax) rather than go out. We prefer and are more convenient with online chat rather than talking with people for real. There are less meaningful relationships today due to all of the factors mentioned above. We have begun to prefer isolation.”"
"“Nuclear technology is a very efficient alternative to non-renewable energy sources. But yet we decided to move forward with more and more types of nuclear explosives. The same is the case with almost every other invention. Although AI initially promised us a better life, we started to lose our basic human qualities due to AI.”"
"“We have begun to lose our basic human habits and instincts, and are actually controlled by devices and apps.”"
"“As Yuval Noah Harari says, what we need now is morality and spirituality. Moral is the reduction of suffering in the world. Spirituality is about asking and looking for answers. Religions give us only answers and no range of questions.”"
"Religion has served its goal of uniting people, building structures in society and developing trust and cooperation. But in the 21. Century we are on the way to objective realities, and religion is an intersubjective reality and now is the only thing it does to create differences in the world, brainwashing people, develop animosity for other beliefs, and offer rituals that only shorten to become a good man. (A Muslim can pray five times a day; a Hindu can pray hours a day in temples; a Christian can go to the church every day but still be involved in immoral activities.)"
"“In the past, every unknown was engaged in religious beliefs. But now Science & Technology has taken over everything. We know the causes of drought, earthquakes, windstorms, etc. They are scientific phenomena and no longer the anger of the gods.”"
"“Because of their technological character, new banks do not need physical bank branches, which helps them save general costs (the costs for the operation of the company). Thus, new banks are able to offer customers lower fees and higher interest rates on check and savings accounts.”"
"“People don’t trust new banks so much because they don’t have physical presence, which makes them a risk for customers in case of problems or challenges. Personal customer service can seem more trustworthy to customers.”"
“Technical competence is still very low in India. Traditional banks can meet the bank requirements of less tech-savvy customers or people in rural areas of the country who prefer personal interaction with the manager.”
"“Business banks contribute to the creation of loans, which leads to more production, employment and consumer spending, which all contribute to the growth of the economy.”"
"“As new banks are fully digital, they operate 24 hours a day and can access their services at any time. They are easy to reach from anywhere through a smartphone.”"
"“Fintech companies can open specialized new banks that target a particular type of customer needs. Thus, for example, LXME wants to be India’s first neo-bank for women to offer product solutions that meet women-specific financial needs and emotional preferences.”"
"“5G in banking will bring urgently needed financial inclusion to the rural and displaced population of India, for which access to a physical bank is not possible.”"
"“The low latence of 5G will enable the integration of education in remote areas of India, where children will be able to high-quality education at home without a networking between them and their favorite teacher. In addition, 5G will be possible to use new technologies such as AR and VR for immersive learning in schools and universities.”"
"“5G will significantly increase the number of networks that can be connected and process up to a billion Internet of Things terminals, allowing machines and people in a factory to communicate with each other, making the business more efficient and reducing the possibility of errors.”"
"“The government will be able to improve its governance and strengthen its digital India initiative, which aims to ensure that government services are made available to citizens electronically, thus strengthening the country in the field of digital technology.”"
Hydrogen is burning and can lead to fires or explosions. So it is not completely sure yet.
"“When the production of hydrogen fuels uses fossil fuels, it can be counterproductive. Therefore, it is important to use renewable energy to produce hydrogen.”"
"“Water fuel cell vehicles do not issue greenhouse gases. This contributes to combating climate change. Since many countries are choosing the energy transition, clean hydrogen vehicles, along with other alternative fuel vehicles, can open the way for sustainable transportation. Since these vehicles do not emite greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide, they can significantly reduce air pollution.”"
"“The prices of fossil fuels are constantly rising. So if more hydrogen vehicles come to the market, the price of fossil fuels may fall.”"
Hydrogen vehicles are much quieter than fossil fuels. They can also reduce noise disturbances.
"“If the hydrogen fuel flows into the air, it can increase global warming.”"
"“Thro the Covid pandemic period, social media helped people preserve their social life.Social media allowed it to stay constantly connected with friends and loved ones. We can easily know what is happening in their lives. It allowed us to communicate with several people at the same time by sharing contributions.”"
"“Given social media, we now have the opportunity to connect with many people, even if they don’t live in our area. In front of social media, we were able to interact with people from our locations or the places we go.”"
"By tracking friends on social media and not communicating with them privately, we can only know the things they post on their accounts. We may not know much about what really happens in their lives. This means that we will not have meaningful ties with friends. The convenience of communicating with people online has led us to meet them outdoors.”"
"""A few people now have social fear because they don't have enough face-to-face interactions. If we avoid talking to people for a long time, we automatically develop a fear of being involved in Smalltalk.”"
“Trolling on social media is a major threat. It affects the self-esteem of many people and also prevents them from building social connections.”
“The book ‘iGen’ has been mentioned that in the next ten years we may see more young people who know exactly the right emoji for a situation – but not the right expression of the face. This can become true if we prefer virtual life rather than real life.”
"“Through close communities or micro communities based on common interests in social media along with private news, social media gave us the opportunity to build real connections with people with whom we can truly connect.”"
"“The NEET examination unifies the admission criteria for medical education throughout the country. Since a high score is required to get to state medical universities, the exam provides merit democracy.”"
"But every year less than 20% of students pass the exam. This makes it obvious that the quality of medical education in other countries where Indian students study is not comparable to the medical education in India. Therefore, it is very important to take steps to enable affordable and high-quality medical education in India.”"
"“Because the exam requires additional studies, the coaching centers take advantage of the situation and charge rupees for coaching for the NEET exam. That’s why students who cannot afford coaching are disadvantaged.”"
"“Students work hard to score good in class 12 exams, but all the hard work is not recognized. And only the NEET score applies for entrance to the medical college, which is very unfair. In addition, the NEET exam is mainly based on the CBSE curriculum. So, State Council students need to study additional things to get a good score on the exam.”"
"""A high score in the NEET exam is required to get admission to state medical universities in India. It costs about Rs.1.25 Crores to study in private medical universities in India. So many students are forced to go to other countries such as China, Ukraine, Russia, the Philippines, etc. to go. to carry out medical training. In these countries, medical training costs around Rs.35 lakhs. In addition, they allow students with low NEET values, but over Cut-off brands.”"
"""Some people look moon to pursue their passion when the revenue from their passion cannot replace the salary from their main activity. Several entrepreneurs take this path and leave their jobs as soon as they earn enough from their new.”"
"“As a study by the Academy of Management Journal from 2021, Moonlighting can provide a sense of control and motivation that can improve the productivity of employees.”"
"“The sudden dismissals of several companies, especially during the pandemic, caused fear among many employees. And so several people took side-gigs or a second job as a security network if they were dismissed.”"
"“Moonlighting can help to increase. A few people want to learn new skills, apart from what they work in their primary job. This can help them develop expertise in their field. Some could get bored with monotonous jobs and thus take up other jobs to learn new skills and thus make their days exciting.”"
“Companies are afraid of information and sensitive data theft and the possibility of sharing it with their competing companies.”
"""Some managers are concerned that the employees may not be productive in their primary job due to fatigue and increased stress. There is also concern about working for other companies during the office hours of my primary work.”"
"“In general, companies offer employees several benefits such as health insurance, health insurance, etc. They think it’s unfair if their employees focus their energy and time on a second job that doesn’t offer any of these benefits.”"
A cash-free economy saves so much money for governments because printing money and sending money to banks requires money and staff. The need to buy or rent land for ATMs will also be eliminated. International payments will also be easier because there is no need to exchange currency.”
Cashless transactions leave digital footprints of financial transactions. They can be used to pursue illegal activities.”
COVID Pandemic increased the number of cash-free transactions. They can prevent the spread of infectious diseases.
"“Money-free transactions are recorded by banks. So, the data will reveal the critical data of people regarding where they spend money. The government can easily access the data of anyone. This can lead to mass monitoring programs. This violates the right to privacy. Money gives us anonymity.”"
A cash-free economy will increase the number of cyber crime.
Technical issues in banking can prevent access to our money. This can affect our daily lives.
"Refugees are violently displaced. They flee for various reasons such as violence, human rights violations, war, persecution of minorities, etc. from their country. They often face life threats in their homeland. They leave their homes and everything else in search of a safer place to live.”"
"“Today, many countries reject refugees who say they pose a economic or security threat. Only a few countries, including Lebanon, Jordan, Turkey and Liberia, accept the majority of refugees. Some host countries forced refugees to return to their homeland and declare that the situation in their homeland is safe. Many of the refugees who were sent so experienced brutal violence and some even disappeared.”"
“All countries should share responsibility for refugees. Refugees should be resettled immediately. They should be equipped with training courses and employment opportunities to help them live a decent life.”
"“A weak global reaction worsenes the situation of refugees. The international community should assist in the reconstruction of the war-shaped countries from which refugees come, so that safe and decent return is possible for refugees. Refugees should not be violently sent to their homeland.”"
"“Many industrial countries spend so much money to protect their borders, but don’t spend money to protect the lives of refugees. More resources are needed to protect the refugees.”"
"“In general, a few teachers punish students who don’t score well in exams, but they don’t even try to understand whether they have any learning disabilities. This leads to self-esteem problems in students. Psychologists can recognize these learning disabilities and recognize these problems and work with teachers to develop teaching strategies that are suitable for students with learning disabilities.”"
"“Many students struggle with several topics such as fear, self-esteem issues, difficulties in building friendship, etc. Advice and support are very important in helping them cope with these problems. The educational institutions should therefore have psychological health professionals to help students.”"
"""In 2020, an average of 34 students committed suicide every day for several reasons such as exam pressure, and relationship issues. Therefore, it is very important to support them in educational institutions. Counselors can help them cope with the pressure, and help them improve their mental health. If the student suffers from psychological problems such as severe depression, consultants will take steps to get them treated by psychiatrists.”"
"“The covid pandemic affected the mental health of many people. As schools and universities were suspended for a long time, many students felt isolated and that had even more negative effects on mental health. Since schools and universities have reopened, students need help to adapt to the new normality.”"
"“Some students don’t even understand what they’re going through, they may not even know how to ask for help. A consultant at their educational institution will greatly help them understand their problems. They also learn to ask for advice and help.”"
"“When higher education is free, the number of graduates will increase drastically. Currently, many people have no access to higher education. So many students do not come to the colleges due to the financial status of their parents. Free education will be very helpful for you.”"
"Now the rich are becoming richer, and the poor are becoming poorer. A free higher education will also reduce social inequality, because since everyone can study and learn the skills at the college, everyone will have the same opportunity to settle in the career of his choice.”"
"""Some students take educational loans to study, and then they have to work hard to pay back their loans. Many people are forced to accept jobs immediately after college to pay back loans. But with free education, they have the freedom in career decisions such as choosing a job or becoming an entrepreneur or experimenting with gigs, etc.”"
"“In many countries there is a lack of qualified workers. If higher education is free, this problem will be solved.”"
"Currently, private investment in education led to an improvement in the quality of education. Without the commercialization of education, the quality of education can not improve much."
"“Less disturbances in public life, less road traffic and less losses for our economy. Since all government officials can be employed at a single time, we can also be alert and factors such as black money, stagnation, etc. to increase. can be reduced.”"
"“To keep the two elections together will also mean to mix the national problems with those of the state. The national issues would overcome the state, which in turn would get less priority from the politicians.”"
"""When state elections are held together with the center, the regional parties can be marginalized because the same party gets majority in the middle can get votes in the state as well."""

"""Fast 3 Lakh people were employed in the fire industry in these places, and 5 Lakh people in packaging, transportation, distribution and sale of these crackers. So the ban would also mean a huge unemployment in these countries.”"
"“The crackers on Diwali have always been on the to-do list in every family. A Deepavali without fireworks will definitely be a cutting in entertainment and recreation for the children, as well as the elderly.”"
"“The ban on fireworks in some places that currently have pollution at its peak, such as Delhi-NCR, will obviously reduce the toxic emissions of gases that have fatal effects on the entire balanced ecosystem. The highest share of particles in Delhi was 2.5 in 2016, making Delhi the most polluted city in the world in terms of air pollution. The Central Office for Pollution Control also stated that the sulphur dioxide content in the air between 21:00 and midnight during Deepavali will be extremely high.”"
"“The market-regulated crackers include chemical components such as saltpeters, carbon and sulfur. When these are fully inflammated, hazardous gas oxides are emitted, causing irritation, reducing visibility and other health hazards. Medical experts explain that the air is contaminated with toxic gases and remains for days after Diwali. The toxic elements that reach the lungs cannot be removed afterwards and can cause serious health problems. This will have a long-term impact on children.”"
"“The ban also triggers religious feelings. In 2017, the Hindu community threw questions about the prohibition of Christmas trees on Christmas, or battle of lamb on sweat, or paint on holi, etc., think it was against their community practices.”"
"India is the second most populated country in the world. For the Indian government, it is already difficult to provide food safety and basic needs to all people in India. A further burden will make the situation worse.”"
“The reception of refugees will lead to a new settlement of some Indians. The Indian government tried to provide protection to Rohingya by relocating some in the Jammu region. This may not be the right step and will cause suffering to the newly settled Indians.”
"“Rohingyas have their own phrase of ethnicity and culture. By accepting them, we will simply add more culture to India’s already widespread culture.”"
"“Leting the Rohingya back to the place where they don’t receive recognition means more loss of human lives and in greater extent. The population of the Rohingya is 1.1 million, and if violence and torture on them continue, there will be no more people in the community.”"
“The acceptance of the Rohingya will give a good impression of the hospitality of our country to the foreign country. This will improve India’s chances of secure a permanent membership in the United Nations Security Council.”
"“The reception of refugees who flee from death situations is an act of mankind. Rohingya people were brutally treated by the government for racism. As a neighboring country, we should accept those people who are in great need.”"
Accepting refugees is a potential threat to the security of any country. Refugees can be a slight blow to terrorists. They can take advantage of the situation and carry out illegal activities with refugees.
“Consensual sex can also be called rape if the woman is willing to submit a false case. There will be no evidence whether it is agreed or not. The punishment of men on the basis of the simple words of women is completely wrong because of the assumption that women do not lie. Good and bad are not related to gender. There are also criminals.”
"""The most abused law in the Indian judicial system is Section 498A, which allows women to file a case on a husband and his family in case of complaint harassment. Many women use this law to persecute money and property from their grandparents. When the law on marriage rape comes into force, many innocent men will be threatened.”"
"Sexual violence violates human rights, regardless of the relationship between the criminal and the victim. IPC 375, the rape criminalizes, discriminates married women for using the section over their husbands. Although a case can be submitted under domestic violence due to marriage rape, it will not prevent the victims from calling marriage rape a crime. Every law on the planet tends to be abused. This doesn’t mean we should not have any laws to avoid wrong cases.”"
"“There will be no sense of security. We cannot sleep peacefully because the value of the cryptocurrency continues to fluctuate. Standard currencies also fluctuate, but not as high as cryptocurrencies. If the value of the standard currency falls, we can still afford to live in our country, because the case of the currency value affects all fields. For example, if the food prices rise, then our wages also rise. But when the value of cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin falls, we lose our hard earned money.”"
"The future belongs to technology. Cryptocurrencies make peer-to-peer financial transactions much easier. This currency can be sent from any part of the world to any part of the world. Therefore, there will be no struggle for currencies such as dollars for the Rupee, etc. to exchange. During the world trip there will be no obstacle to exchanging our currencies with local currencies.”"

"“Reality shows have put the participants under tremendous pressure to show themselves well every time. Children can’t deal with this stress, and this can cause mental problems. Almost all reality shows involve the process of excluding the participants one by one on each level. Losing, above all, is not so easy for children. This can give children an emotional tribute.”"

Triple Talaq violates fundamental rights such as the right to equality, the right to non-discrimination and the right to dignity because this provision is only available to men and not to women. Women are forced to live in the fear of being unilaterally divorced from their husbands. This violates your right to live with dignity.”"

"“Today, every man is considered a potential rapist. When a woman raises a false insult against a man for revenge or for any other reason, society is more likely to believe in the words of the woman. Society and media reveal the accused before the investigation. This attitude of society helps the victims in real cases. But the scope of false cases is ignored. The same does not apply to complaints against women. When the complaint is against a woman, people doubt the authenticity of the case. What if sexual harassment against a man is a wrong case? Some people think men can take everything with them. False misconduct cases will lead to irreversible loss of reputation and cause psychic injuries to the accused and his family.”"

"“The migratory workers are overrepresented in the most precarious jobs, they are too often underpaid, they work under unbearable working conditions and live in terrible housing facilities. Workers are vulnerable to abuse and exploitation. And they continue to face unhuman working and living conditions because of the lack of effective enforcement. Trade unions are often not permitted on buildings with precarious jobs and migratory workers cannot therefore be sufficiently informed about their labour and trade unions rights. Third-country nationals are even more vulnerable than EU migrants/mobile workers.”"
"“Al the number of migratory workers within the TKN is growing considerably, there is no adequate policy to protect their rights.
